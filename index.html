SEWARD - BROADPASS
MP 1.6 SEWARD DEPOT (Left SB, Right NB)
The original Seward depot was constructed in 1917 at what is now Adams
Street and Ballaine Boulevard to serve the railroad line. In 1928 the building
was moved to its current location on Railway Avenue following a flood of
Lowell Creek.
1
MP 2.9 AIRPORT (Left SB, Right NB)
The Seward Airport with a nice view of Resurrection Bay behind it. With
weekly flights to Canada, Seward Airport is likely the smallest international
Airport you will ever see.
**FYI-Approximate Airport Operational Statistics:
-Aircraft based on the field: 25
-Single engine aircrafts: 25
-Average Operations: 203 per week
(42.8% air taxi, 38% transient general aviation, 19% local general aviation,
38.1% General Aviation Itinerant and 1% military)
2
MP 3 RESURRECTION RIVER
The bridge over Resurrection River is the geographic city limits for the city
of Seward. The river’s water source is the Harding Ice Field and explains
why the river is “dirty” with glacier silt. Fish gills are delicate and easily
damaged by abrasive sediment particles so not many salmon are present.
3
EXIT GLACIER ROAD
Exit Glacier in the Kenai Fjords National Park is just 10 miles north of
Seward, and is the easiest to reach of the many glaciers that flow from the
Harding Ice Field. Exit Glacier Road takes you to the Ranger Station and
picnic site, only a half of a mile from the glacier. Trails lead you to the
glacier and your choice of either a 3⁄4 or 3.5 mile hike around the area. Exit
Glacier is a remnant of a larger glacier once extending to Resurrection Bay.
SEWARD - “GATEWAY TO KENAI FJORDS NATIONAL PARK”
Grigor Shelikhov, a Siberian merchant, built the first Russian settlement on
Kodiak in 1784. Shelikhov hired Alexander Baranov and in 1792 ordered the
building of ships in the new colony. Baranov entered the inlet he chose for
the shipbuilding site on Easter Sunday, 1793 and named it "Voskrensenskaya
Gavan," - Resurrection Bay. The PHOENIX, the first Russian ship built in
what was to become America, was launched in August, 1794. Frank Lowell
and his family settled on Resurrection Bay in 1884. Mrs. Lowell, who was of
Russian and Native extraction, and several children and their spouses, had
homes in what became part of the original townsite. Mail and supplies for
the gold fields in the Hope-Sunrise area were landed here as early as the
1890's.
The founding of Seward is dated from the August 28, 1903 landing party
headed by the Ballaine brothers, the founders of the Alaska Central
Railway.Seward's earliest settlers, many of whom had arrived on the
steamer SANTA ANA in 1903, had built a thriving town. Millionaire's Row, a
series of larger homes on Third Avenue, were built and occupied by Alaska
Central Railway officials by 1905. Many of these early homes and
apartments such as the Ballaine House, Hale House, Cameron House,
Holland House, Winter, Stewart and Williams Houses and Harborview

Apartments still stand inn Seward today.4 Except for a sharp decline after
the devastating 1964 Earthquake, Seward’s population has grown steadily,
and today Seward and its vicinity is home to about 2,852.
Seward is named after William Henry Seward who served as the United
States Secretary of State during the administrations of Presidents Abraham
Lincoln and Andrew Johnson. Seward negotiated the United States
purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867. The treaty was signed March 30,
1867, and is celebrated annually as Seward’s Day. The price, $7.2 million
dollars, amounted to about two cents per acre. In modern terms, the cost
was equivalent to $133 million in 2020 dollars or $0.37 per acre. Critics of
the deal to purchase Alaska called it "Seward's Folly" or "Seward's Icebox."
Opposition to the purchase of Alaska quickly subsided with the Klondike
Gold Strike in 1896.
5
Seward is known for being to hometown of Benny Benson, who was an
orphan that resided at the now historic, Jesse Lee Home. On a return trip
to Alaska from Washington D.C., territorial governor at the time, George
Parks, was inspired by other states flags he saw on his trip, and had the
Alaska American Legion hold a competition for children grades 7-12 to
design Alaska’s state flag. A 7th grader at the time, Benny designed a
simple, yet meaningful design that was chosen out of 142 designs across the
state. The constellation Ursa Major or the “Great Bear” symbolized
strength. The stars were colored gold to represent Alaska’s gold resources,
and the North Star symbolized Alaska being the northernmost state and its
prospective future. The blue background represents the Alaskan Forget-
Me-Not flower, (which became the state’s flower when Alaska became a
state on January 3rd, 1959). Benny was awarded a watch with the flag
emblem on it and a $1,000 educational scholarship, which he used to study
diesel mechanics.
6
The 1964 earthquake was a defining moment in Seward’s history. Thirteen
people died – mostly due to the tsunamis that followed the 9.2 quake.
Eighty-six homes were demolished and hundreds of others damaged.
Seward’s waterfront industry was destroyed: docks, railroad, fish
processors, oil companies, and most of the fishing fleet. From its founding
in 1903, the town had served as a transportation hub with its marine, rail,
and, later, highway links to other points in Alaska. The earthquake severed
all these connections, and it took years for the community to rebuild its
economic base. Oil storage tanks along Resurrection Bay exploded and
caught fire. Afraid Seward would be consumed in flames, people headed
out of town, but the first bridge over Resurrection River had sunk five feet
and was impassable. There was no way out. The quake also loosened huge
amounts of silt that flowed into the bay. As the sea bottom heaved and
dropped, a huge whirlpool developed and water drained into the void. The
Alaska Standard, a docked oil tanker, hit bottom. Vast portions of the
waterfront, 50 to 400 feet wide, simply fell into the water. The first
tsunami, as wide as the bay, and perhaps 30 feet high, rolled in about 30
minutes after the quake began. Wave after wave continued, and did not
stop until the following morning. As testimony to its strong spirit and for
the way its residents pulled together after the quake, Seward was
recognized as an All-American City in 1965.

The seasonal economy during the summer is based around fishing and
tourism. Seward’s year round economy is based on the port (shipment of
coal and freight), the prison and the research of the marine life.
POLAR BEAR JUMP
The Polar Bear Jump is a weekend event held in January, when several
costumed characters plunge into Resurrection Bay to raise money for the
American Cancer Society and the Kenai Peninsula Children with Cancer.
Weekend events include a bone-chilling parade, bachelor/bachelorette
auction, waiter/waitress contest, and oyster slurping. The first Polar Bear
Jump was held in 1986.
JACKPOT HALIBUT TOURNAMENT
The Jackpot Halibut Tournament is held every year from mid-May through
mid- September. Prizes are awarded each week of the tournament for
various categories, largest fish, tagged fish, and even a left-handed caught
fish award. Prizes are also awarded based on random target weights
ranging from 60 to 120 pounds. A grand prize jackpot winner is determined
at the end of the tournament. In 2011, Chad Aldridge won the Jackpot prize
of $28,260.00 for the largest catch during the season that weighed in at
350.8 lbs.
SILVER SALMON DERBY
This event is held in August. Every year the derby offers a $10,000 prize for
the biggest fish, but there is ample cash and other prizes for all of the top
50 salmon.

MT. MARATHON
According to folklore, the race began when two sourdoughs had an
argument about whether it was possible to climb and descend the mountain
in less than one hour. “Impossible”, one said. To settle the argument and the
resulting wager, it was decided to hold a race with the loser to furnish
drinks for the crowd. The race is just 265 feet short of three miles, but is
3,022 feet straight up and the medics are ready and waiting as the runners
come across the finish line. While short, it is grueling with an often muddy
and treacherous trail. The first race took 1 hour and 2 minutes, and it
became an organized event in 1915 and is held annually on the 4th of July.

THE SEWARD HIGHWAY
The Seward Highway follows the route of an old mail trail, the Johnson
Trail, which was built paralleling the north shore of the Turnagain Arm. In

1915, the Crow and Indian Pass trails were in heavy use as supply routes to
the Iditarod gold fields in interior Alaska.
Construction began on the highway after WWII in 1948 and was completed
in 1950. The highway was not paved until 1954. Improvements are
continuously being made on the road as travel increases between
Anchorage and the Kenai Peninsula.
The Seward Highway runs 127 miles from Seward to Anchorage and has
been designated an All-American Road and National Forest Scenic Byway.
MP 12 DIVIDE
(The commentary for Divide can be given when you’re just about to cross
the divide (as opposed to other stories, which should be started about 2
minutes in advance. Pay attention to the orientation of the train to see if
you have reached to divide yet. If you can’t tell if the train is going up or
down, put a pen on a table, or open the sliding door to a restroom half way
and see which way it falls to determine if you have reached the divide yet.
It sounds silly, but it works!) Right now we’re making our second crossing of
the Kenai Mountains at an elevation of 694 feet. This is a watershed divide.
If it falls on the south side (right... here!) it will flow back into Resurrection
Bay. If water falls on the north side of the divide (right … here!) it will flow
into Kenai Lake and then Cook Inlet.
MP 14.5 SNOW RIVER
Soon we’ll be crossing over Snow River, which is a good example of a
braided stream. Braided streams occur when a river is made up of
numerous small channels intertwining between sand and gravel bars.
Braided streams are created when the water flowing from a glacier cannot
transport its load. When there is a decrease in the speed of the water and
sediment is deposited on the floor of the channel creating bars. These bars
separate the channel in to several smaller channels creating a braided
appearance. Further sediment is built up due to the accumulation of glacial
ice and debris, this debris holds up the flow of water and erosion of
sediment. These glacially fed rivers are extremely common in Alaska.
MP 22 KENAI LAKE (Right SB, Left NB)
Here to our 9:00 side, we can see the eastern end of Kenai Lake. It is the
headwaters to the beautiful and infamous Kenai River. The lake is more
than 24 miles long, over 600' deep in certain spots and is very cold! Its
turquoise blue color is from the light reflecting off of glacial silt suspended
in the water. There is an abundance of Lake Trout and Dolly Varden and
every species of salmon moves through the lake to their spawning streams.
MP 22 KENAI HISTORY (Right SB, Left NB)
Across from the Kenai Lake at our 9:00 are the breathtaking geographical
landmarks called the Kenai Mountains. Interestingly enough, the word
“Kenai” is Athabaskan for “flat land”. It is however named after one of the
most historic cities of Alaska: Kenai, which is located just behind the Kenai
Mountains. Kenai got its start around 1000 B.C. when it was first
established by the Kachemaks. Then, in 1000 A.D., they were replaced by
the Dena’ina Athabaskan Indians. It wasn’t until 1741 when the Alaskan
natives had their first interaction with the Russians, and at that time over
1500 Athabaskans were already thriving in Kenai. The Russians built a
trading post named Ft. Nicholas Redoubt in 1791. It was built in the middle
of the village of Kenai where it was used to import and export furs and fish.
They also built Russian Orthodox churches in the village. The “Holy
Assumption of the Virgin Mary Church” is the most well-known. Built back
in 1895, it still stands to this day! In 1957, “black gold”, or oil, was found in
the Swanson River. It was the first oil strike in the state of Alaska. Ever since
then Kenai has been a very important oil importer. If you were to visit Kenai
today, you would find many large oil tanks and refineries.
4
MP 23.3 LAWING (Right SB, Left NB)
(Lawing comes up very quickly. Northbound: to the 3:00 side after Kenai
Lake disappears from sight. Start your story before you pass Lawing, then
have people watching for the small cluster of buildings.)
Named for the late "Alaska Nellie" Lawing, a pioneer woman employed by
the railroad in its earliest, roughest days. She was the first woman to hold a
contract with the federal government, as the Alaska Railroad was federally
owned. In 1923, Nellie used her life’s savings to purchase her final home, a
roadhouse on Kenai Lake. The railroad stop along the blue-green waters
was renamed Lawing when Nellie Neal married Bill Lawing, and together
they built the roadhouse into a popular tourist stop on the Alaska Railroad.
Vegetables from Nellie’s garden were served with fresh fish from the lake
or with game from the nearby hills, and Nellie’s stories, often embellished
with her rollicking tall tales, kept her audiences delighted. Celebrities,
politicians, tourists and even locals came to enjoy the purely Alaskan
hospitality at the Lawings’ roadhouse on Kenai Lake.
9
People from all over the world heard about Nellie and her heroic efforts.
Many wanted to write her, but no one knew her address so they simply
addressed them to “Nellie, Alaska” and she was so well known that the fan
mail would reach her.
The following are just short examples of the sort of woman Alaska Nellie
was and the magnitude of courage and gumption she possessed.
· She pulled a dog sled (with no dogs) around her shoulders for 30 miles to
move supplies to her roadhouse.
· As a business woman, she built and managed a Roadhouse and charged
$.50 for dinners and $1.00 per night for lodging. (She was the first woman to
get a contract from the government to build a roadhouse on the railroad).
Nellie named the roadhouse Grandview and cut up an old blue coat, ironed
it, and sewed it on white cloth to make a sign.
· She built a museum to display all the animals she killed and skinned
(herself), then made it a tourist attraction for those traveling along the
Alaska railroad.
· Her way of getting dinner items together was putting a trout line in the
river with a bell on it. When the bell rang (meaning she snagged a fish), she
knew dinner was ready.
· When her pet black bear, Mike, was found dead with a brown bear
standing over him, she chased down the bear and killed it.
· The U.S. president Herbert Harding and his wife, Lou Henry Hoover were
guests at her roadhouse.
MP 25 FALLS CREEK
Around the turn of the century there were many small gold mines high in
the mountains here. These were lode gold mines where the miners mined
the quartz veins that contained gold. The quartz was then crushed and
broken, then the gold was separated by from the quartz using gravity and
water to separate the two, such as gold panning. These were small
operations that continued into the 1950s, but very little mining activity has
gone on since then.
MP 29.5 MOOSE PASS (Right SB, Left NB)
A former railroad construction camp, this area gained its name from a mail
carrier in 1903. It seems this mail carrier had continual confrontations with
the numerous local moose while making his mail runs. He began calling it
Moose Pass hoping to attract hunters to lower the moose population!
Well, I don’t think it worked, because today Moose Pass is home to many
moose, along with its approximate 200 residents!

5
MP 32 UPPER TRAIL LAKE
The lake you see out the 9:00 side of the train is Upper Trail Lake. This
lake is fed by the run off from Trail Glacier. When all the conditions are
right, this lake is a mirror with a perfect reflection of the surrounding
mountains. (Typically the lake is calm in the morning, but by afternoon, a
slight breeze ripples the lake too much for a good reflection shot. If this is
the case, don’t even let your passengers know what they’re missing. Be on
the lookout for moose at the North end of Upper Trail Lake) on the far side
of the lake you can see a salmon hatchery run by the Cook Inlet Aqua
Culture Association (nonprofit). The salmon are raised here and then
released into Resurrection Bay and Cook Inlet.
MP 33 BRIDGE OVER TRAIL CREEK
Not far from here, the Johnson Pass Trail takes off from the railroad and
heads North, This used to be a wagon road connecting the railroad to the
mining towns of Hope and Sunrise on the Turnagain Arm. Today it is a
popular summer hiking and mountain biking trail.
MP 39 ARR HISTORY
As we continue along our trip today I would like to take a moment to tell
you about the construction of the Alaska Railroad. Let’s start the story way
back in 1867, that’s when The United States purchased Alaska from the
Russians for $7.2 million dollars. William H. Seward, who was Secretary of
State at the time, arranged the transaction. Today we know that the U.S. got
quite a good deal, but back then most folks thought the purchase of Alaska
was a big mistake. They thought Alaska was nothing but a frozen wasteland.
In fact, the purchase of Alaska was commonly referred to as Seward’s Folly!
From 1867 to the turn of the century, Alaska lacked any reliable means of
transportation. We had no way to get our natural resources to market.
The gold rush of 1898 brought attention to Alaska remoteness, rugged
terrain and inaccessibility. Travel by river was only 4 months of the year.
The few trails which existed were primitive and torturous. This hurt the
growth of our economy greatly. Several attempts had been made by
private companies to build a railroad in Alaska, all but two (Whitepass
Yukon and Copper River railroads) ended in failure, due to high
construction costs. At the turn of the century many thought it outrageous
that a territory over two and a half times as large as Texas was without a
railroad. Many people thought that a railroad was so important to the
development of Alaska, that if the private sector couldn’t do it, the
government should. Finally in March 1914, after extensive lobbying efforts,
the Federal Government appropriated funds to complete the rail line and
created the Alaska Railroad.
At the completion of the Panama Canal, (Jan 1914) all the excess equipment
and manpower were transferred to Alaska. At the peak of construction
4500 workers were employed. Col. Mears of the Army Corps of Engineers
was selected to build the ARR. The approved route originated in the deepwater,
ice-free port of Seward, on the Kenai Peninsula and extended north
along Turnagain Arm, into the coalfields of the Matanuska Valley and
ultimately ended in the interior city of Fairbanks. Construction of the
Alaska Railroad was completed in 1923. President Warren G. Harding came
to Alaska in July of 1923 and drove the golden spike in the town of Nenana
commemorating the completion of the Alaska Railroad. It took
approximately eight years and cost $70 million, or nearly $1 billion in 2012
dollars! Interestingly enough, at the time of completion, the combined
populations of the three major towns on its route, Seward, Anchorage, and
Fairbanks were only 5,400 people.

The Alaska Railroad was of great value during WWII to transport military
personnel, civilians and equipment. However, due to heavy usage during
this time, it needed to be rebuilt. Part of this rehabilitation was to replace
old equipment. In 1944, the Railroad bought its first two diesel engines to
start replacing the steam engines that had been used up until this time.
The last steam engine was sold in 1964. (The last steam engine used on the
ARR was the 557 and was recently donated back to the Alaska Railroad.
Once the 557 is restored, the Railroad plans on using it for tours and
excursions.) This was the first and only railroad built and run by the United
States Federal Government. In fact, the U.S. Department of the Interior ran
the Alaska Railroad until the 1980’s. In 1985, the State of Alaska bought the
Alaska Railroad for $22.3 million. Now a board of directors appointed by
the Governor of Alaska runs the Alaska Railroad. Gold was discovered in
the Klondike region of the Yukon on Aug 16, 1896. 100K people attempted
to get there. 30-40K made it to Dawson, only 4K found gold and a few
hundred became rich. The peak of the “rush” lasted one year from the
summer of 1897 until the summer of 1898. It ended as quickly as it began
with the discovery of gold in Nome in 1899.
MP 42-40 20-10 SPRUCE BARK BEETLE
(This story may be moved to any place you see ‘beetle-kill’ trees)
You might have noticed that many trees in this area look dead or dying.
That is because they have become infested with the Spruce Bark Beetle.
These beetles are present in small numbers in all spruce forests, but over
the last decade their population has increased dramatically and caused a
major infestation problem in South-Central Alaska. The beetles burrow
into and lay their eggs in under the bark of the tree, disrupting the flow of
nutrients throughout the tree. This eventually kills the tree. After
remaining in the infested tree for two years, the new beetles will emerge
after three consecutive days where the temperature reaches 61 degrees
Fahrenheit, and find another spruce tree to infest. Many solutions have
been proposed, including controlled burns of ‘beetle-kill’ areas as well as
using a spray designed to defend spruce trees from the beetles. This spray
is used in and around the city of Anchorage in an attempt to prevent the
beetles from penetrating city limits and creating these extreme fire
hazards. It seems there is no quick fix for the Spruce Bark Beetle
infestation, but hopefully, we’ll have the situation under control in the next
few years. *Great spot to start talking about the tour guide program if you
haven’t already…
MP 42 TRAIL GLACIER (Left SB, Right NB)
Soon, to our 3:00 side, we’ll have a view of Trail Glacier, which is
responsible for Trail River and both Trail Lakes that we will pass later on our
journey today Trail Glacier gets its name from its “medial moraine”. When
you look at the glacier, it has a big strip of dirt running up the middle.
Someone once thought it looked like a trail. As glaciers carve their way
down mountains, they pick up and scrape lots of debris and rocks along
their sides, these areas are called “lateral moraines”. Long ago, two glaciers
came together in this valley to form what we now know as Trail Glacier.
Where the lateral moraines of these glaciers converged, we have the
medial moraine of Trail Glacier. The origin of the name for Trail Glacier
comes from the original foot path used by the Native Americans to cross
the area between valleys. It was later turned into and wagon road and
eventually the first railroad built into Alaska followed this route. Hence the
names Trail Glacier, Trail River and Trail Lakes. Trail Glacier will be on the
3:00 side, and it is absolutely beautiful. Something you’ll definitely want to
have your cameras ready for, especially because we only see it twice
between tree openings for a few seconds!
7
MP 44.8 TRAIL GLACIER (Left SB, Right NB)
Point out Trail Glacier to your passengers. Most engineers will slow down
for a view if time allows.
MP 45 GRANDVIEW
Right now, we’re making our first crossing through the Kenai Mountains.
The summit of this pass is at an elevation of 1,063 feet was named
Grandview by Alaska Nellie where she had her Grandview lodge.
“Grandview seemed the most appropriate name to me for ‘Mile 45’.” Nellie
wrote in her autobiography, Alaska Nellie. ”Being without paint with which
to paint the sign, I found an old blue coat, which I washed and pressed, cut
letters for the sign from it and sewed them to a strip of white oil cloth. This
pennant was tacked to the porch in front of the house. ‘Mile 45’ was now
Grandview.“ Also 10 on our 3:00 is the Grandview whistle stop and overlook.
You can see there are 2 small wooden shelters, a pit toilet, and a 1500’ trail
that leads up to an overlook of the majority of the valley.
Shortly to our 3:00 side, you’ll see a beautiful cascading waterfall that
feeds into an old beaver pond. This is the headwaters of the Placer River,
Placer Falls, Grandview Falls, or as some tour guides in the past referred to
this gorgeous seven-tier waterfall, Snow White Falls” since there were seven
dwarves!
In 1916, Nellie Trosper became the first woman to get a roadhouse contract
from the Railroad. Nellie became known for her feats of strength and
endurance that bordered on the fantastical and grew more and more
exaggerated every time she told the stories to entertain her guests.
One legend of Alaska Nellie began near here in the winter of 1920 during a
snowstorm while waiting for the mail carrier. She eventually realized the
mail carrier must be in trouble and ventured out to find him. She found the
man, brought him back to her cabin and thawed him out. She was given a
gold nugget necklace with a small diamond set in a star as reward for her
heroic efforts.
Likely due in part to her plucky approach, she was awarded a lucrative
government contract to run a roadhouse at mile 44.9, a scenic location she
promptly named Grandview. Her agreement with the Alaska Engineering
Commission was to provide food and lodging for the government
employees; her skill with a rifle filled out the menu, and her gifted
storytelling kept her guests highly entertained. Nellie described the
accommodations at Grandview in her book, ‘Alaska Nellie’:
“The house was small but comfortable. A large room with thirteen
bunks, used as sleeping quarters for the men, was just above the
dining room. A small room above the kitchen served as my
quarters. To the rear of the building a stream of clear, cold water
flowed down from the mountain and was piped into the kitchen.
Nature was surely in a lavish mood when she created the beauty of
the surroundings of this place. The timber-clad mountains, the
flower-dotted valley, the irresistible charm of the continuous
stretches of mountains and valleys was something in which to
revel.”

You're now entering the northernmost rainforest in the world. Notice the
trees change from spruce to mountain hemlock. Also notice the hair-like
Usnea moss hanging from the branches and bark, “Old Man’s Beard” is a

lichen that looks like light colored hairs on the trees. Usnea can only grow
in pristine environments and is used as a natural immune booster, by the
local indigenous communities. Usnea is used by the local indigenous people
as an antiviral. Steeped as a tea and mixed with the Chaga mushroom they
can create a power packed immune booster.
MP 47 THE ‘S’ CURVE
Soon we’ll be traveling on a section of track known as the ‘S’ Curve. While
on the ‘S’ Curve, we’ll be making tighter turns. This will be the best
opportunity to get a look at the front/back of the train as we go around the
curves. The track on the ‘S’ Curve has a 3% grade, meaning for every
hundred feet forward we travel, we’ll be (dropping/gaining) 3 feet in
elevation. That might not sound like much, but it is quite steep in terms of
railroads. This is the steepest grade that we have on the Alaska Railroad.
ALANA FALLS (Right SB, Left NB)
*Just before the ‘S’ Curve starts. A very large and majestic waterfall can be
seen on the 9:00 side. This waterfall was once so spectacular to a young
tour guide during her first year with the Alaska Railroad, she decided it
needed a name. Unable to find an existing name for the falls, in 2006, this
waterfall became lovingly and “unofficially” referred to as “Alana Falls” (“Uhlay-
nah”), which the guide decided to name after herself!
MP 48 BARTLETT GLACIER (Left SB, Right NB)
To our 3:00 side, we can see the Bartlett Glacier. This is the closest
Glacier to the Alaska Railroads tracks and is one of the approximately
100,000 glaciers we have in the state of Alaska. At Bartlett Glacier’s
closest point, it is about a half mile away from the tracks. This glacier was
named after Frank Bartlett, Alaska Central Railroad Civil Engineer who
designed the famous Loop train trestle that once stood in this valley.
MP 49 THE LOOP (Right SB, Left NB)
Looking to our 9:00 side along the river, you may be able to see two large
cement pylons, as well as some wooden trestles sticking out of the ridge on
the left/ride side at the MP 49 marker These are remnants from the
famous "Loop". Back in the early days of the Alaska Railroad, to make it
through this pass the railroad couldn’t just lay down a set of tracks from
point A to point B, as the pass was too steep. Necessity is the mother of
invention, and a railroad civil engineer by the name of Frank Bartlett drew
up the plans for a series of wooden train trestles that filled up this entire
valley, making a large circle and then crossing over themselves, and
following along the ridgeline to our left/right by the mountain base to make
it through this steep pass. Trains would enter the Loop and begin to make
a big circle and would cross over the track they had been on about 150 feet
above it. This lessened the grade of the track and allowed the locomotives
to climb the hill. The Loop was a very expensive section of track to
maintain and when the railroad started upgrading to diesel locomotives in
around the late 1940s into the 50s, they bypassed the loop and gradually
disassembled it. The Loop was replaced by the ‘S’ Curve, and those large
pylons and few rotting wooden trestles are all that remains of the Loop
today.
*cite & add info about water buckets used for sparks from fixed steam
engine axles (The Alaska Railroad – Bernadine Prince, “The Loop”)
FYI- did you know that for years there was no MP 50 on the Alaska
Railroad? MP 50 was in the Loop. When the loop was replaced by the ‘S’
Curve, instead of renumbering the miles, MP 50 was deleted. The mileposts
used to go from MP 49 to MP 51! As of summer 2016, the Alaska Railroad
put in a “new” milepost 50.
MP 52.8 TUNNEL
9
(Start as soon as you finish the Loop story. You want to have plenty of time
to prep your passengers for the tunnels.)
Ice-free Resurrection Bay was selected as the terminus of the railroad, and
the city of Seward and a port facility (sheet 1, Mile 0.0) were developed.
Reconnaissance surveys extended as far north as the Tanana River in
interior Alaska, and by 1909, track was laid across the Kenai Peninsula to
Kern Creek (Mile 70.5). The 2.2-percent grade from Mile49 to 54 past the
foot of Bartlett Glacier required the construction of seven tunnels, a
horseshoe trestle that curved 235°, and roadbed and trestles that looped
through 394° of total curvature.
12
We will now be going through a series of five tunnels. The river you see
below us is the Placer River and this is the Placer River Gorge (Plah - sir,
NOT Play - sir). We’ll have nice views of the gorge in between the tunnels.
The best photo opportunity is 1st and 2nd tunnels, on the 3:00 side. But
heads up, there’s only about 8 seconds in between the 1s and 2nd tunnels!
The movie "Runaway Train" with John Voight was filmed here 1985 (Repeat
picture-taking tips here)
The geology throughout this area is primarily made up of metamorphic
rock; rock which has been altered by pressure and heat. But it started as
sedimentary layers deposited roughly 65 million years ago by glaciers. After
being deposited by the glaciers, it was buried deep beneath the earth’s
crust and then intense pressure from the land above and the heat of the
earths depths transformed the rock, and then due to tectonic uplift and
the erosion caused by the rivers you can now see it within the walls of the
gorge.
FYI – the majority of your passengers will be looking at the river gorge, but
watch for beautiful waterfalls on the 9:00 side. Continue commentary after
you’ve passed through the tunnels.
This area is known as Tunnel Alaska. There was a post office here from
1930 to 1931. Our current elevation is 491 feet. The 1964 epicenter was just
35 miles from Whittier in Prince William Sound and occurred along this
fault line. The Whittier fault runs thru this valley and is easily seen from
both sides of the train. This particular type of fault is known as a Transverse
fault. The Kenai Peninsula is sliding away from Alaska at 2 ½ inches per year
and will eventually become an island. Kodiak Island was once attached to
Alaska and is moving on the same plate. During the 1964 quake this fault
line moved 26 feet. A famous example of a transverse fault is the San
Andreas in California.
FYI - A freight train traveling at 45 mph can plow through four feet of snow!
You might think that this would preclude the need for the snow fleet, but
the Grandview area gets a lot of snow, and conductors have told me they’ve
known it to snow up to 3 feet/hour!
MP 54 SPENCER GLACIER (Left SB, Right NB)
According to the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service an area now
at the water's edge near the train stop was the glacier's edge in 1958. Since
that time various studies have shown that the glacier has receded on
average 103 feet, between 1990-2007. According to one of the guides with
Chugach Adventures, the receding rate is only increasing. A good example
of a piedmont glacier, it is 3 miles from the track at this point and one mile
wide at the face. It is fed by the Sargent ice field (not the Harding) which is
connected to Whittier glacier.
Spencer Glacier got its name from Edward A. Spencer, a railroad
timekeeper who disappeared in 1905. Spencer would walk from camp to
camp along the railroad, collecting time cards, and paying employees in
gold bullion. One evening, despite being warned of the dangers of
12 THE ALASKA RAILROAD BETWEEN ANCHORAGE AND FAIRBANKS Guidebook to
Permafrost and Engineering Problems
10
avalanches and glacial travel at night, Spencer decided to travel from Camp
52 to Camp 55 (names to camps were given for the milepost they were
adjacent to). The trail was plainly marked by stakes, but unfortunately these
were difficult to see in the dark. When Spencer did not arrive at Camp 55 a
search was unable to find any trace of the young timekeeper. A year later,
Spencer’s body was found about 2000 feet from the trail. It was presumed
that he became hypothermic and lost his way eventually succumbing to the
elements. Unfortunately, his cash box was never found which supposedly
contained about $4,000 in gold, (about $80,000 in today’s money).
From the obituary of Edward A. Spencer, a general timekeeper with Alaska
Central, who attempted to travel at night across the glacier that now bears
his name. He died in 1905 but wasn’t found until a year later:
“Lying face downward with the hands clasped across the
forehead, the body of Edward A. Spencer was found in a slight
depression of the slope above the glacier opposite mile 53 of the
railroad Saturday Afternoon,”
13
You might have also noticed some wooden shelters on our 9:00 and those
are for the Spencer whistle stop. Here, the Alaska Railroad’s Glacier
Discovery Train drops off passengers for day-hikes, rafting, and also
camping. This is also the location of the Spencer Bench Cabin. A five mile
zig-zagging hike will take you up 1,900 ft. to a secluded trapper-style cabin,
which can sleep up to six people. With breathtaking views and access to a
nearby creek and trails. Brought in from Ketchikan, then built onsite by
local Forest Service employees, this one-of-a-kind scenic escape sells out
quick!
14
Eventually a trail will connect Spencer Glacier with Grandview, some 10
miles away. The best area to see bears is between bridge over Placer
River and Grandview. Best photos of Spencer Glacier are just south of the
bridge by the gun platform sign, least number of trees and view looking up
the river at the face of the glacier. Best photos of the lake and icebergs is
just before entering tunnel No.1.
The area where the tracks have been moved from the mountainside in
order to accommodate for avalanches. (After best views of Spencer Glacier
when you cross over the bridge) Evidence of the avalanche can be seen as
snow is leftover in the springtime, and the tightly packed line of willow
trees is where the tracks used to lay.
MP 57 PLACER RIVER VALLEY
This valley we have been traveling through is known as Placer River Valley.
The small streams you are seeing are portions of the Placer River which we
will be following for the next several miles. This also marks the southern
boundary of the Municipality of Anchorage. The Municipality covers over
1,955 square miles, making it one of the largest municipalities in the US, and
comparable to the size of the State of Delaware. Coming up soon on the
left/right side will be an active eagles nest, which is only 25 yards off the
track.
*Good example of a beaver dam very close to track is on the opposite side
of track just south of the eagles nest and lots of beaver lodges in this area.
The best place to see moose is in the Placer River Valley and Spencer
Valley.

MP 62 GLACIER INFORMATION
Glaciers cover about 29,000 square miles of Alaska or 5% of the land area;
which is 128 times more glacial coverage than the rest of the United States.
Glaciers have been a dominant factor in carving out Alaska's terrain for
millions of years. Ice close to 1/2 a mile deep during the Pleistocene age
almost carved a fjord all the way to Cook Inlet, had this ice completed its
journey, the Kenai Peninsula would now be an island. Many examples of
glaciation can be seen on exposed rock. They are ground smooth and
rounded by the ice flow. A glacier is formed when annual snow
accumulation at the top of the mountain is greater than the amount melted.
Over time as more and more snow is not melted during the summer it
collects and this causes the snow to compress forming dense, very heavy
ice that moves downward aided by the forces of gravity.
Because of the great density of this ice it absorbs all colors of light except
the blue wave length. Different colors of light have different amounts of
energy and only the blue light that has some of the greatest amount of
energy can escape the density of the ice. As the ice melts the dense crystal
structure breaks down and reflects all the colors so it looks white. That is
why you will sometimes see the deepest blue in the new cracks and
crevasses; the ice has not had time to break down and is still very dense.
The colors sometimes appear the richest on cloudy days. One reason is
because the direct sunlight makes the wet ice give off a glare making it hard
to see the true colors. Many glaciers will look gray or dirty simply due to
the amount of rocks and debris which become embedded into the ice,
while some will appear white because they have a higher amount of air
bubbles trapped in the ice.
Most of Alaska's glaciers are currently receding. You can't actually see a
glacier move, but there are clues to the movement. Large chunks of ice
may break off from the face of the glacier; this is referred to as calving. If
you are going on a cruise through Resurrection Bay in Seward, you may
have the opportunity to see a tidewater glacier calve. It is quite a
spectacular sight to see a glacier calve into a large body of water. If you
stand near a glacier for any length of time you can hear the movement in
sounds such as groaning or creaking. Sometimes this noise can get quite
loud. Glaciers can move at varying speeds, some as fast as a foot or more a
day, others as slow as only a few inches a year. Three things usually
determine the speed at which a glacier moves: the thickness of the ice, the
angle of the terrain it is on and the climate of the area.
SKOOKUM GLACIER (Left SB, Right NB)
Skookum Glacier is an example of a recently melted glacial valley and
outwash. Skookum means really good, right on, and excellent or it can mean
tough and durable. So if you’re Skookum, you’re trustworthy, honest,
reliable and hardworking. The three types of glaciers we will see today are
hanging glaciers, piedmont glaciers, and tidewater glaciers for those of you
taking a boat tour. Hanging glaciers originate at the peaks of the mountains
and are attached to the slopes, but do not extend into the valley bottoms.
Piedmont glaciers originate at the peaks and flow into the valley bottoms.
Tidewater glaciers are similar to piedmont glaciers however their faces
terminate in the ocean.
MP 64 PORTAGE
The area we’re traveling through now is Portage Valley. Thanks to Portage
Glacier and the Begich-Boggs Visitor Center, Portage Valley is one of the
most visited tourist attractions in Alaska! This area received the name
Portage over 100 years ago, as the Athabaskan, Yupik and Russian fur
traders would use the glacier as a means to portage, or travel, between
Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound.
12
ARCTIC TERN
(Nests are sometimes seen between train tracks around the Whittier cut-off
or grassy mounds in the surrounding waterways) The arctic tern is a
medium sized bird growing to an average height of about a foot tall with
around a 2 ft. wing span. They are grey and white with black capped heads,
and their beaks and feet are bright orange. Their diet consists of mostly
small fish, crustaceans, and insects. The terns’ travel from arctic breeding
grounds to its wintering grounds off of Antarctica covers 24,000 miles! This
is the farthest yearly journey of any bird.
MP 64.5 ARRC YARD: PORTAGE
The rail line you see off to our 3:00 side is headed through the Chugach
Mountains for the town of Whittier. And it actually does go ‘through’ the
mountains, via 2 tunnels, the longer being 2.7 miles in length! Established
as a military base and railroad port during WWII, Whittier was only
accessible by boat and by train until recently! In the year 1998 construction
began to convert one of the railroad tunnels into the first tunnel to be used
for both train and car travel. The tunnel was completed in the year 2000
and cost $80 Million dollars. It is also the longest highway tunnel in North
America.
MP 65 OLD PORTAGE STATION/EARTHQUAKE (Right SB, Left NB)
We are now passing by the old town site of Portage, a place whose history
ended abruptly in 1964. You may notice as we come into the area that on
the 9:00 side of the tracks there are some sunk-in houses. These are the
last remnants of the old town of Portage (you can see the dilapidated
Portage Garage and sometimes the old rusted truck next to it in the
springtime) On Good Friday, March 27, 1964 at 5:36 pm the strongest
earthquake ever recorded in North American history hit south-central
Alaska! It measured an incredible 9.2 on the Richter scale, and shook in
most areas for about five minutes. The ground moved with such a
tremendous force that the Good Friday quake was felt over 700 miles
away! Devastation and destruction was rampant throughout the state, but
here in Portage they endured considerable devastation.
Most of the land here is made up of glacial silt, which is rather unstable to
begin with. When this area was shaken so violently for so long, the land
actually liquefied! When the shaking stopped, the elevation here had
dropped around 6-10 feet. Fortunately, for the residents it was low tide
here and any resulting tsunami did not have enough energy to cause
damage to the Cook Inlet and Turnagain Arm regions. But the lowered
elevation meant that the tide came much further in than before. So the
new tide deposited hundreds of cubic inches of sediment around the
foundations of these buildings, across the road, the tracks, and even went
hundreds of yards into Portage Valley.
FYI - For many years it was believed that the Good Friday earthquake had
a magnitude of 8.6, however as technology improved, the quake was
recalibrated using the newer method called the Moment Magnitude Scale
and has since been upgraded to 9.2. The Richter scale is no longer used.
When making seismograph recordings of 6.0 or larger using his scale the
readings become illegible. The 4 most powerful earthquakes of this century
are: Chile May 1960 9.5, Alaska 1964 9.2, Sumatran 2004 9.0 and Japan 2011
9.0. Notice how all these large quakes are on subduction zones.
The Alaska Railroad, as well as many businesses, was drastically affected by
the quake. Rail north and south of Anchorage was bent and twisted,
bridges were buckled or destroyed, and many stretches of track were
completely covered by mudslides. It took the Alaska Railroad $27 million
13
dollars to repair all the damage caused by the quake. The line from
Anchorage to Fairbanks was in service within 2 weeks, but it took seven
months to repair the train tracks from Anchorage to Seward and Whittier.
Even once initial repairs had been completed, problems still remained. At
high tide the track was under water in places, so the railroad could only run
during low tide! The railroad crews had to build up the road and track to
create an artificial barrier to contain the arm.
GHOST FORESTS
Something you may be noticing is all of the dead trees in this area. Since
the land wasn’t very high above sea level in the first place, when the ground
sank 12 feet, salt water from Cook Inlet seeped into this area and over a
period of time become absorbed into the root systems of the trees. This
salt eventually drowned and killed the trees and the saltwater acted as a
preservative. It is estimated that it will take well over 50 more years for
these trees to decay completely, thus they will serve as a standing
monument to the great '64 quake for a long time yet to come. During
quakes not only can there be subsidence but up lift as well. Montague
Island in Prince William Sound rose 33 ft.
15
FYI – many people will ask if these trees are petrified. They are not; they
are just well preserved by saltwater.
MP 65 TWENTYMILE RIVER
Soon, we’ll cross the Twentymile River, which flows from the Twentymile
Glacier. This river is popular place to catch "hooligan”, also known as smelt
or candlefish and are a small and very oily fish. Early Alaskan Natives used
the hooligan primarily for their abundance of oil.16 They would dry the fish
for several days, and collect the oil and use this it to dip their dried food in.
This oil was a vital part of their diet. The Hooligan is also known as the
Candlefish, because the southeast Alaskan Tlingits would insert a twisted
spruce bark wick into the dried fish and light them as you would a candle.
Today they are most commonly used as bait for Halibut and other fish.

MP 64 OLD PORTAGE STATION
We are now passing by the old town site of Portage, a place whose history
ends abruptly in 1964. On Good Friday, the strongest earthquake ever
recorded in North American history hit March 27, 1964 at 5:36 pm southcentral
Alaska! It measured a 9.2 on the Richter scale, and shook for four
and a half minutes. Believe it or not this area actually shook for 15 minutes!
The ground moved with such a tremendous force that the Good Friday
Quake was felt over 700 miles away! Devastation and destruction was
rampant throughout the state but the area we are traveling through now
was hit considerably hard.
On the 3:00 side of the tracks you can see some remains of houses that
were once a part of the Portage town site. Most of the land here is made
up of glacial silt, which is rather unstable to begin with. Well, when this
area was shaken so violently for so long, the land actually liquefied! When
the shaking stopped the elevation here had dropped around 12 feet.

16 https://alaskaoutdoorssupersite.com/hooligan
14
Fortunately, for the residents it was low tide here and any resulting tsunami
did not have enough energy to cause damage to Cook Inlet and Turnagain
Arm regions. But the lowered elevation meant that the tide came much
further in than before. So the new tide deposited hundreds of cubic inches
of sediment around the foundations of these buildings, across the road, the
tracks, and even went hundreds of yards into Portage Valley.
(FYI - For many years it was believed that the Good Friday earthquake had
a magnitude of 8.6, however as technology was improved, the quake was
recalibrated and the magnitude has since been upgraded to 9.2.)
The Alaska Railroad, as well as many businesses, were drastically affected
by the quake. Rail north and south of Anchorage was bent and twisted,
bridges were buckled or destroyed, and many stretches of track were
completely covered by mudslides. It cost the Alaska Railroad $27 million
dollars to repair all the damage caused by the quake.
The line from Anchorage to Fairbanks was in service within two weeks, but
it took seven months to repair the train tracks from Anchorage to Seward
and Whittier. Even once initial repairs had been completed, problems still
remained. At high tide the track was under water in places, so the railroad
could only run during low tide! The railroad crews had to build up the road
and track to create an artificial barrier to contain the arm.
Something you may be noticing is all of the dead trees in this area. Since
the land wasn’t very high above sea level in the first place, when the ground
sank 12 feet, salt water from Cook Inlet seeped into this area and over a
period of time become absorbed into the root systems of the trees. This
salt eventually killed the trees and acted as a type of preservative. It will
take well over 100 years for these trees to decay completely, thus they will
serve as a standing monument to the great '64 quake for a long time yet to
come.
Although at one time this whole area was permeated with salt, this is no
longer the case. This water does have a higher level of salinity than fresh
water, but is not as salty as it once was. The ground has actually been
slowly rising back to its initial elevation before the 1964 earthquake! This
incredible process has been happening in this region for the last several
hundred years, it is known as isostatic rebound. Glaciers of any type are
extraordinarily heavy ice that can be hundreds of feet thick compressing
the soil. Portage Glacier occupied this area over 500 years ago. Now that
the glacier has retreated off this ground, the pressure and weight is no
longer holding the soil down and it has been slowly rising. You can think of
it in term of when you compress a cleaning sponge, when you release the
pressure the sponge slowly regains its original form. Except for the 12-foot
setback during the earthquake, in the 50+ years since the earthquake the
soil has regained its previous elevation. This has allowed the freshwater
from the lakes and streams to flush out much of the salt.
MP 65 PORTAGE
The area we’re traveling through now is Portage Valley. Thanks to Portage
Glacier and the Boggs-Begich Visitor Center, Portage Valley is one of the
most visited tourist attractions in Alaska! This area received the name
Portage over 100 years ago, as Athabascans, Chugach Eskimos and Russian
fur traders would use the glacier as a means to “portage” or transport
goods, between Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound.
Some of the following commentary all the way into Whittier may not be
relevant because of the weather in the valley that creates heavy cloud
15
coverage and at times it is impossible to see anything at all, use your
judgment when considering what commentary to relate.
EXPLORER GLACIER
If you look out at the 3:00SB/9:00NB position, towards the top of the
mountain you can see Explorer Glacier. This is known as a Hanging Glacier,
because they cling or hang on to steep mountainsides and are usually
wider than they are long. It was named for the many explorers that came
through this area and traversed the Portage Glacier over to the Passage
Canal.
GLACIER INFORMATION
Glaciers cover about 29,000 square miles of Alaska or 5% of the land area;
which is 128 times more glacial coverage than the rest of the United States.
Glaciers have been a dominant factor in carving out Alaska's terrain for
millions of years. Ice close to 1/2 a mile deep during the Pleistocene age
almost carved a fjord all the way to Cook Inlet, had this ice completed its
journey, the Kenai Peninsula would now be an island.
A glacier is formed when annual snow accumulation at the top of the
mountain is greater than the amount melted, eventually over time as more
and more snow is not melted in the summer it collects. This causes the
snow to compress itself forming very heavy ice that moves downward
aided by the forces of gravity. Because of the crystalline structure, it
absorbs all colors of light except blue light, different colors of light have
different amounts of energy and only the blue end of the color spectrum
has the high energy, fast-moving wavelengths that can escape the ice and
reflect back to our eyes. As the ice melts the dense crystal structure breaks
down and reflects all the colors so it looks white. That is why you will
sometimes see the deepest blue in the new cracks and crevasses; the ice
has not had time to break. The colors sometimes appear the richest on
cloudy days. One reason is because cloud cover will absorb the slower,
red-end of the color spectrum before it even reaches the ice, making the
blue even more vibrant. Many glaciers will look gray or dirty simply due to
the amount of rocks and debris which become embedded into the ice,
while some will appear whiter because they have a higher amount of air
bubbles trapped in the ice.
Most of Alaska's glaciers are currently receding. You can't actually see a
glacier move, but there are clues to the movement. Large chunks of ice
may break off from the face of the glacier, and we refer to this as calving. If
you are going on a cruise through Prince William Sound, you will probably
have the opportunity to see a tidewater glacier such as the Columbia calve
into Prince William Sound. It is quite a spectacular sight to see a glacier
calve into a large body of water.
If you stand near a glacier for any length of time you can hear the
movement in sounds such as groaning or creaking. Sometimes this noise
can get quite loud. Glaciers can move at varying speeds, some as fast as a
foot or more a day, others as slow as only a few inches a year. Three things
usually determine the speed at which a glacier moves: the thickness of the
ice, the angle of the terrain it is on and the climate of the area.
Portage Glacier ended its forward advance in 1893 and began receding in
1914. As the glacier melted the water formed a lake in the valley that had
been hollowed out by the massive ice. The glacier has been rapidly
receding the past few years and in 1995 a chunk of ice calved off and
exposed land on the other side of the lake. Holland America Princess

operates a boat service on Portage Lake that takes you right up to the face
16
of the glacier, which is about three miles from Begich-Boggs Visitor Center.
Portage Lake is on average, 600 feet deep.
MIDDLE GLACIER
There is another example of a hanging glacier at the 3:00 position. This is
Middle Glacier; it is after Explorer, but before Byron Glacier.
BEGICH-BOGGS VISITORS CENTER
Opened in 1986, The Begich-Boggs Visitor Center near Portage Glacier is a
facility run by the US Forest Service and is the flagship visitor center for
the 5.4 million acre Chugach National Forest. They have a wonderful
exhibit about glaciers, wildlife, cultural history and feature an award
winning film called "Retreat and Renewal: Stories from Alaska's Chugach
National Forest" which is an informational film about glaciers and the
Chugach National Forest. The center here sees approximately 80,000+
visitors each year and the recreation area covers over 8,600 acres. The
Portage Glacier is considered the 2nd most visited tourist attraction in the
state. The Inside Passage is the most visited attraction in Alaska. The
Begich-Boggs Visitor Center was named in honor of House of
Representatives Majority Leader Thomas Hale Boggs of Louisiana, and US
Representative Nicholas Begich of Alaska, they were flying from Anchorage
to Juneau and their last radio contact was very close to Portage Pass on
October 16, 1972. Even after an extensive search of Chugach National
Forest and Prince William Sound, no trace of the airplane has ever been
found. Also onboard were Aide Russell Brown and Pan Am Airways
President and Pilot Don E. Jonz.
TURNAGAIN SHOULDER, (short tunnel)
We have just entered into the first of the two tunnels on our way into
Whittier. This tunnel is 4960 feet long, which is approximately nine-tenths
of a mile long. It will take us just under two minutes to pass through.
***As soon as we exit this tunnel, the once very visible Portage Glacier, now
very reclusive, will be visible for about four seconds. It is very difficult to
spot the glacier and plenty of warning is needed if the glacier
is mentioned. Glacier is NOT visible northbound.***
ICE WORM (In the tunnel)
At the visitor center the forest rangers take you on a variety of
guided tours to the surrounding glaciers. Many people think
the Ice worm is a myth, but I assure you it is very real!
The Ice worm is actually a small black worm, related to the
common earthworm that lives on the surface of the glacier, on
the perennial snow pack or in glacial puddles. It can only
survive cold temperatures and anything over 40 degrees
Fahrenheit will kill them. They feed on red algae that grows on
the snow and ice and also pollen that blows in on the wind.
VIEW OF PORTAGE GLACIER (as you exit the tunnel)
Immediately on the 2:00SB side, look across the lake and you
may be able to have a quick view of Portage Glacier!
BEAR VALLEY
Glaciologists have discovered evidence of glaciation in Alaska
reaching back 5 million years, and suspect the area has been
glaciated for nearly 15 million years. Few other places on the
planet have experienced such a prolonged period of
glaciation. In cooler periods, glaciers covered all of the coastal
plateaux. During warmer periods, they retreated to the
17
mountains. About 20,000 years ago, the Earth’s climate cooled and the last
of the great Pleistocene ice age glaciers advanced down from the Chugach
Mountains. Glaciers formed in the stream beds of the coastal plateau and
carved deep valleys.
When the glaciers receded about 12,000 years ago, they had scoured the
Earth’s crust down to the granite roots of the Chugach range and scoured
out deep fjords (glacially carved valleys filled with sea water) creating
Prince William Sound and the rugged, glacially sculpted Chugach
Mountains. The pure-water runoff from the 27 mile-long Matanuska glacier
is used for drinking for a large part of Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city, and
the surrounding areas. Malaspina Glacier is the largest glacier in the state,
with an area of 1,500 square miles and extending 50 miles from Mount St.
Elias toward the Gulf of Alaska.
17
ANTON ANDERSON TUNNEL
This is the Anton Anderson tunnel, it is 2.5 miles long (13,300’) and at the
time of completion was the 4th longest rail tunnel in America. It was dug
between 1941 and 1942. Two teams digging on opposite sides constructed
the tunnel and when they meet in the middle the centerlines of the two
sections missed dead center by less than a foot. In fact the tunnel is so
straight that when you enter the tunnel you can see the light on the other
end.
18
The Tunnel is owned by the railroad and operated by Alaska DOT under a
co-operative agreement; which vehicles pay a toll to drive through it to
Whittier. This one will take us several minutes to get through. When we get
to the center of this tunnel above us will be a solid 2600 feet of Greywacke
(a variety of sandstone) above our heads and on top of that is a 150 foot
slab of ice. This is Maynard Glacier and we are traveling right through the
heart of Maynard Mountain. Maynard Mountain was named after Robert L.
Maynard who was a U.S. Army helicopter pilot who was killed in April of
1964, while he was aiding victims of the Good Friday Earthquake.
This tunnel was named after Anton Anderson, who was the chief engineer
given the task of bringing rail access to Whittier. Mr. Anderson arrived in
Alaska in 1919, and served as the location engineer for the Matanuska Valley
colonization project. He was also an engineer for the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, chief engineer for the Alaska Railroad, and mayor of Anchorage.
In 1976 the tunnel was dedicated to him for his faithful service to Alaska
and the Alaska Railroad. In the year 1998 construction began to convert
the railroad tunnel into the first tunnel to be used for both train and car
travel. The conversion was completed in the year 2000 and cost $80
Million dollars. It is also the longest highway tunnel in North America.
This tunnel is quite an engineering feat. While many people have driven on
a road overlying railroad tracks, this is the first time it has ever been done
in a tunnel. Underneath us to create the surface we are traveling over all
existing rock and track were removed. 1,800 pre-formed concrete panels
were put in place, with grooves running through them for the train tracks.
The Concrete is permanent but on either side there is asphalt for a larger
driving surface and to enable easy access to the tracks and concrete if
repairs are needed.
Also we have been passing “safe houses” all along this tunnel on the
9:00/3:00 side. These 8 safe houses that are distributed approximately
every 1600 feet and are used only in case of an emergency evacuation. The
https://www.alaskapho 17 tographics.com/alaska-photo-articles/alaska-glacier-photos/
18 https://dot.alaska.gov/creg/whittiertunnel/history.shtml
18
safe houses capacity is approximately 55 people comfortably, with survival
amenities including first aid, firefighting equipment, drinking water, landline
phone, and even a basic toilet. All safe houses are equipped with fresh air
ventilation from the outside that is tempered twice before entering. There
are 50 closed-circuit video cameras located throughout the tunnel and safe
houses, and two computer systems that ensure trains and cars do not enter
the tunnel at the same time. Inside there are “pull outs” for disabled
vehicles. The rock around us is quite solid, although for the majority of the
tunnel there is a wire mesh that covers the top of the tunnel to catch any
loose rocks. And in areas that are less stable metal sheets are in place.
But the most incredible feat is the ventilation system. Because of the
increased traffic and with cars producing more emissions that before
ventilation is a key component. The tunnel’s system incorporates a variety
of portal fans and smaller reversible jet fans. There are six 75-horse power
jet fans distributed over safe houses 1 and 8 and four 300-horse power
portal fans at the entry points of the tunnel for emergencies to purge the
tunnel. For a lower operating cost, during normal, daily operations the
reversible jet fans will keep the tunnel air healthy. In case of emergency, the
larger portal fans will remove smoke and emissions away from any vehicle
stopped in the tunnel. This is the first time in the United States that these
two types of fans have been used in conjunction with each other.

WHITTIER WEATHER
Its always prettier in Whittier! Whittier is best known for being a very wet
place! In the summer time (from the end of April to the end of August)
Whittier receives an average of 17 feet of rainfall. That is 1¼ inches of rain, on
average, a day! In the wintertime, Whittier has an annual snowfall of 21 feet!
But that usually accumulates to only about 14 or 15 feet constantly on the
ground. Because of this great amount of snow fall the town of Whittier has
used several tunnel systems between buildings for daily commutes. The
tunnel between the Begich tower and the Schoolhouse is the only one still
in use today.
Whittier is situated in a large cove and most of the weather systems that
move through Prince William Sound eventually get funneled through
Portage Pass. As these systems make their way across the ocean they
accumulate moisture from the warm sea air. The heavily laden clouds
cannot make it over the mountain pass and dump the majority of their
moisture on Whittier until becoming light enough to pass over the
mountain to the Turnagain side of the mountains. Interestingly Whittier has
no direct sunlight from November to February, as the sun does not rise
above the mountains that surround it.
If you look up at the mountains on the 9:00SB/3:00NB side you can see
Learnard Glacier. This is a classic example of a Rock Glacier. Learnard
Glacier is a retreating hanging glacier with blue ice and used to have a large
tunnel at its terminus which I have been in. It currently looks like it is
covered with debris, but it was well studied by earlier glacial geologists in
the area, and was known to extend to the base of the mountain and have a
moraine near the current tank farm (dating to the Little Ice Age advance
around the late 1800's).
20
AIRPORT
The Whittier Airport is out on our 9:00SB/3:00NB side. Yes, that strip of
gravel, 1,100 feet long and 50 feet wide is the main runway. That is why
most people elect to ride the train or drive into Whittier!

WHITTIER HISTORY
The town of Whittier and Whittier Glacier were named after the poet John
Greenleaf Whittier; the town has a population of just less than 200 people.
Interestingly enough almost the entire town of Whittier lives in one of two
condominium buildings, the 14 story Begich Towers, which happened to be
the tallest building in the territory when it was built. The other is the
Whittier Manor (or Sportsman Inn).
One of the most interesting buildings in Whittier is the Buckner Building.
Initial construction of this building began in 1949 and it was completed in
1952. Designed as a “city under one roof” for military personnel and
families, it was the largest building in the territory when completed. Is rises
six stories above ground with two stories below, comfortable housing for
over 2,500, a 350-seat theater (for live performances and movies, a four
lane bowling alley, library, hobby shop, church, hospital, restaurant,
cafeteria, and bake shop among other amenities. It was never fully
occupied when the military left in 1960 and has been abandoned ever
since. It is still structurally strong but the aesthetic condition has degraded
over the years. It has changed owners many times since the military left,
with various renovation plans, from a high scale resort to condos and hotel
rooms. However it currently is in the possession of the City of Whittier,
with no plans at the time for the historical building.
The Alaska Marine Highway offers ferryboat service to Valdez and Cordova
out of Whittier. Many residents of Anchorage also own small boats and
dock them here. During WWII, the port of Seward could not handle all of
the supplies being shipped in to construct military bases. It was decided to
add a second port to the Alaska Railroad. Whittier was the best option.
Opening a route from Passage canal would eliminate 52 miles from the
Seward route and the two tunnels would provide protection from attack.
Prince William Sound also provided a sheltered harbor for military ships
waiting to unload. Thus, the war department approved construction of the
Whittier cutoff in June of 1941 and by June of 1943 the line was open for
business. Costing almost $11 million the Whittier Cutoff was one of the
most expensive projects undertaken during WWII.
MP 69 IDITAROD TRAIL
Although it might not be evident today, as we head toward the Girdwood
Depot, we are traveling parallel to Alaska's Iditarod National Historic Trail.
The Trail extends north from Seward, parallel with the Alaska Railroad from
Seward to Girdwood, then heads up to the Matanuska Susitna Valley and
finally northwest to Nome. Trails have always been important in Alaska.
Over the years trails were established by Native peoples, Russians and
Americans. The trails were vital for the transport of supplies and people
between villagers and towns. As gold was discovered in various parts of
Alaska, trails became more important. In many areas of Alaska, during the
summer months, food, supplies, medicines, mail and other resources were
able to travel via ships and boats, however in the winter, when these water
routes froze up, trails were an efficient and reliable means of
transportation.
Before 1904 various winter mail routes carried mail from Resurrection Bay
to the gold rush cities of Hope and Sunrise on the north coast of the Kenai
Peninsula. As gold camps developed in the interior of Alaska new routes
were needed. In 1905 the U. S. Congress established the Alaska Road
Commission, the purpose of which was to organize and establish trails and
roads in Alaska. In 1908, a crew led by Walter Goodwin was given the task
of surveying a possible winter mail route from Seward to Nome. With the
discovery of gold on Christmas Day in 1908 on Otter Creek, a tributary of
20
the Iditarod River, and the ensuing gold rush to that area, the improvement
of the Seward to Nome trail became a priority. In 1910-11Walter Goodwin
was put in charge of an expedition to mark, clear and realign were
necessary the trail from Nome to Seward via Iditarod. The trail became a
major highway for people and supplies going north and people and gold
coming south from the gold camps of Iditarod and Flat. During the peak of
the Iditarod Trail's use from 1908 to around 1923, thousands of people used
the trail and tons of supplies, mail and gold were carried over it.
One of the biggest shipments of gold was in 1915 when Bob Griffis, Jim
Healey, Ernest Bede and William Lodge carried 2,416 pounds of gold from
Iditarod to Seward on three dog sleds, with 38 dogs. The gold was valued at
about $600,000. They left Iditarod on November 22 and arrived in Seward
on December 25. Extremely cold weather slowed them down. In 1915 1troy
ounce of gold was worth $18.99. Today a troy ounce is worth somewhere
around $1,100, so that shipment would be worth around $37,000,000 today.
With the completion of the Alaska Railroad in 1923, use of the southern
part of the trail decreased dramatically. People and freight went to Nenana
by rail and then across to the Iditarod area by dog sled. Northern parts of
the trail continued in use between villages, but dogs were increasingly
replaced by snowmobiles.
Today the Trail is best known as the route of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog
Race, first run in 1973. The Race is approximately 1,000 miles. There is a
ceremonial start in Anchorage and then the race begins in Willow, or
further north if there is a lack of snow and it ends in Nome. Joe Redington
is called the "Father of the Iditarod” because he was the driving force
behind the first race in 1973. Joe was also instrumental in having the
Iditarod Trail established as a National Historic Trail by the U. S. Congress
in 1978. The Historic Trail System, with all it side and connecting trails is
approximately 2,300 miles long.
MP 71 CHUGACH- “THE LAND OF MANY USES”
CHUGACH NATIONAL FOREST
Chugach National Forest is the second largest national forest in the US.
(The first largest national forest is also located in Alaska, Tongass National
Forest in southeast Alaska.) The Chugach National Forest is nearly five
million acres in size and occupies nearly all of the forest scenery across the
arm. The Tongass is over 3 times its size 17+million acres. The name,
Chugach, comes from an Eskimo tribal name that means ‘rainmakers’. The
mountain range is still known by the same name.
The Chugach National Forest was established back in 1907, 16 years after
the National Forest System Act was signed into law in 1891. It is America's
2nd largest National Forest covering almost 6 million acres. 2 million acres
of this forest are still covered with ice and glaciers. The Chugach National
Forest is primarily made up of Sitka spruce and hemlock but also includes
some birch, aspen, white spruce black spruce. At elevations above 2,000
feet the forest is covered with alpine tundra and remains snow less for only
a short period of time each year.
The Chugach Eskimo once inhabited most of the Prince William Sound
area and they are the southernmost Eskimo tribes. It is believed that the
Chugach Eskimo inhabited the Prince William Sound area for thousands of
years while Athabascan Indians inhabited the Turnagain Arm region.

CHUGACH STATE PARK
http://www.akhis 21 torycourse.org/articles/article_artID_85/
21
At 495,000 acres, it is America’s third largest State Park. It was established
in 1970 and provides easy access to both visitors and residents who want to
hike, ski, camp, view wildlife and take part in many different outdoor
activities. Chugach State Park blends into the boundaries of Chugach
National Forest.
Alaska’s State Park system was started in 1959 and encompasses more than
3 million acres around the state. The largest state park in the U.S. is Wood
Tikchik State Park located about 500 miles west of Anchorage and directly
north of Dillingham.
MP 72 KERN CREEK
(FYI - This was all the track that had been laid from Seward to Anchorage
when the US government purchased the financially ailing Alaska Northern
Railroad in 1915 for approximately $16,000 a mile, 15 cents on the dollar!)
MP 74.8 GIRDWOOD – “THE GLACIER CITY”
The small town of Girdwood is not too far from here. Girdwood was
named after an Irish immigrant and linen merchant with four gold claims
along Crow Creek. In 1896 Colonel James Girdwood staked a gold claim on
Crow Creek, and in 1907 he established Crow Creek Hydraulic Gold Mine
Company. This company had an annual bullion income of more than
$100,000. Today there are still some active gold mines in this area, the
most famous being the Crow Creek Mine. You can rent a gold pan for a
nominal fee and try your luck at mining in Crow Creek. There is also a
jewelry store operated by the mine and all of the gold in the store is mined
from the creek. The town of Girdwood is a part of the municipality of
Anchorage, but is better known as one of Alaska's only year-round resort
community with an identity all of its own. It has an estimated year round
population of 1,800 people and most commute for school and work every
day to Anchorage. During the winter this population grows to about 3,000
people with all of the skiers that come to this area. Girdwood is home to
the Alyeska Resort, a luxurious year-round resort, and the Alyeska Ski
Resort that is the state's largest and only 5 star Ski Resort. (During the
beginning of the summer, it is easy to see the ski lifts against the snow on
Mt. Alyeska.
Mt. Alyeska is 3,939 feet tall and receives an average of over 500 inches of
snow per year. The Conde Naste Traveler magazine has noted Alyeska's
view as being the best of any North American ski area and it was also
named 1 of the top 25 ski resorts in North America by Skiing Magazine. The
name Alyeska is an Aleut word that means the Great Land and was the
Aleuts' name for Alaska. The word Alaska was taken from Alyeska. In the
winter, skiers, as well as dog mushers and snowshoers, enjoy trips along
Glacier Creek. In the summer, visitors can ride the aerial tram up the
mountain for a beautiful view of the Chugach Mountains and Turnagain
Arm, and you can also enjoy a wonderful dinner at the Seven Glaciers
restaurant.
FYI - The largest gold nugget to be found in Alaska was mined from the
Anvil Creek mine near Nome and weighed 155 troy ounces. Fort Knox near
Fairbanks and Alaska Gold Company in Nome are just a couple of the
many large scale mining operations actively supporting Alaska's economy.)
MP 78 CAPTAIN COOK STORY
As I've mentioned, the body of water we’ve been following is known as
Turnagain Arm, and it flows into Cook Inlet. Captain James Cook inspired
the name for it back in 1778. At the time, Captain Cook was on his third
voyage of discovery for the King of England. His mission was to sail through
the South Pacific and claim any new islands discovered in the name of
England, then sail north exploring the Pacific Coast, searching for the
22
fabled Northwest Passage. In Cook’s time, it was believed that a major
waterway connected the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. If this waterway
existed, it would dramatically shorten the time it would take for ships to sail
between Europe and the Orient. So, many explorers were hoping to be the
first to find the Northwest Passage, including Cook. Captain Cook set sail
from England aboard the ship the Discovery. (Accompanying him was
renowned artist of the day John Webber, and a midshipman who would
eventually find his own fame as a world explorer, George Vancouver.)
Sailing with the Discovery was a second ship, the Resolution, commanded
by William Bligh. The two ships sailed into the South Pacific, then north
along the coast of Alaska, exploring the many waterways hoping to find the
fabled Northwest Passage.
When Captain Cook and his men reached what we now know as Cook
Inlet, they were tired and discouraged. Though Cook was doubtful that
this body of water was the supposed Northwest Passage, on the urging of
his men, he sailed up into Cook Inlet until he got to the point where
Anchorage now sits and the inlet split into two arms. He sent Captain Bligh
up the northern section of Cook Inlet, which was then and still today
known as Knik Arm, and Cook sailed into the body of water we see to our
9:00 side. The silt that fills this valley creates a very “anfractuous” channel
(twisting and turning, yet never breaking) that snakes along the arm
Captain Cook had to continually “turn again” to stay within the deepest
part of the channel. When he reached the end of the arm, realizing that it
was indeed, not the fabled passage, he sadly wrote in his journal that he
had to “turn again” and named this body of water Turnagain River. Years
later, George Vancouver navigated this waterway and determined it to be a
part of Cook Inlet and changed the name to Turnagain Arm. The Cook Inlet
is fed by the Susitna, Matanuska, and Kenai rivers. The Turnagain Arm is fed
mostly by Twentymile River, Portage River, and the Placer River.
When Captain Cook met up again with William Bligh they continued on
exploring Alaska's coastline into October of 1778. By then the winter ice
flows were threatening the boats so Captain Cook decided to sail back to
the Hawaiian Islands to wait out the winter. He planned to return to Alaska
and the Russian Kamchatka Peninsula to continue searching for the
Northwest Passage the following spring. However, during this return trip to
the Hawaiian Islands a confrontation broke out between the Hawaiians and
Captain Cook and his men. This fight resulted in Captain Cook's death. At
51 years old, Captain Cook had spent more than 30 years of his life at sea
and opened up a world of undiscovered lands. Many of Captain Cook's
maps and drawings were so accurate they are still accepted today. And
many places in Alaska still bare the name that Captain Cook gave them.
Ironically, William Bligh's name seems to be synonymous, throughout
history, with disaster. He was with Captain Cook on his failed voyage to
Alaska and he was with Captain Cook when Cook was killed in the
Hawaiian Islands. Later Captain Bligh's men mutinied on him when he was
Captain of the ship the Bounty; some of you may be familiar with the book
Mutiny on the Bounty. Historical note. Bligh and 18 men were put in a 23
foot uncovered launch which was so heavily loaded the gunwales were only
inches above the water! With only a compass and quadrant he sailed 3,618
miles, a 47 day voyage. He lost one crew member to hostile natives and one
to malaria. This sailing feat is unmatched in history.
In 1989, while maneuvering to avoid floating ice from Columbia Bay, the
Exxon Valdez Oil Tanker ran aground on none other than Bligh Reef in
Prince William Sound, spilling 11 million gallons of oil, causing the worst oil
spill in our nation's history!
MP 81.7 BROOKMAN
23
This siding, formerly known as Bird Point, was renamed in honor of Kerry
Brookman in February 2000. Mr. Brookman was a heavy equipment
operator clearing an avalanche in this area when another avalanche
unexpectedly came down on his equipment, ending his life. Mr. Brookman
had worked for the Alaska Railroad for 21 years and was considered one of
our best heavy-equipment operators.
MP 84 AVALANCHES (Can be moved around as necessary look for
obvious place to talk about it) A very common hazard in Alaska is the vast
number of avalanches that occur in the winter. The nine-mile section of the
Alaska Railroad and the Seward Highway between Girdwood and Bird
Point is known as one of the most avalanche-prone transportation
corridors in the world. The Seward Highway is a lifeline for the
communities of Girdwood, Kenai, Homer and Seward. With an average of
5,000 vehicles traveling this stretch of road every day in the winter, it is
very important to keep this road open as much as possible. Thus, to
prevent unexpected avalanches from stranding motorists, and perhaps
causing injuries or fatalities, the State Department of Transportation will
close the road temporarily in the winter to "shoot down" potential
avalanche chutes. They use a 105mm Howitzer cannon which was
purchased by the Alaska Railroad from the Army to send up an artillery
shell to dislodge the snow, making it easier to “control” the sometimes
unpredictable avalanches.
Also, this section of track we are traveling on is a recent addition. The
Alaska Railroad Corporation and the Department of Transportation
completed a large project here in 2004. The rail was originally right along
the side of the mountains, and the shore was much closer to the mountains
as well. But by placing thousands of cubic feet of rock into the inlet the
shoreline was extended over 100 feet! Then the railroad tracks and road
were moved to their present location. All of this was done to place the
train and cars as far away from the avalanches as possible. And if you look
to the 3:00 side you see that small raised bike path, it acts as a type of
retention wall for snow coming down during avalanches. During winter
operations passenger trains are not allowed to travel south of Portage due
to avalanche conditions.
MP 86.6 BIRD CREEK –Comes quickly! (If you see fisherman, give the
following commentary)
We’ll soon cross Bird Creek, which is a popular fishing spot. Since this area
is so close to Anchorage and the Seward Highway, it can be prone to
‘combat fishing’, where it seems you have so many people lined up along
the water fishing (sometimes shoulder to shoulder!) that it looks like there
are more fisherman than fish! (Feel free to include your own description of
and/or experiences with combat fishing)
MP 88 TIDES
The body of water is Turnagain Arm, which flows into Cook Inlet, all of
which is part of the Pacific Ocean. The water we see is salt water mixed
with fresh water creeks and glacially fed rivers, and we are approximately
at sea level. Turnagain Arm, along with Knik Arm, have North America's
second greatest tide change, reaching almost 40 feet (38.9').
(FYI – the highest tides in North America are in the Bay of Fundy, in
Canada, between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick with a maximum tide
change of 56 ft.)
Here you can see a vast area of mud flats (if the tide is out). Mud flats are
created by deposits of glacial silt from the many glacially fed rivers in the
area. As glaciers are formed, rocks, vegetation and other debris become
buried in the snow. With the progression of time and the movement of the
glacier, these rocks and other items become pulverized into very fine
24
sediment. As the face of the glacier melts, this sediment is carried in the
melt-off water and gives many of Alaska’s rivers and streams their dirty or
murky color. Eventually the melt-off water makes its way to the ocean, and
much of the sediment settles, creating mudflats.
These mud flats can be dangerous for unsuspecting explorers who venture
out on the flats at low tide. Even though the mud can seem as solid as
concrete when the tide is out, it only takes a short period of time for this
mud to become like quicksand as the tide comes in. This is one of the few
places in the world where you can see a "bore tide". Because of the great
tidal changes, the outgoing tide will meet the incoming tide and the two
forces fight each other, creating a "wall of water" until the incoming tide
eventually overcomes the outgoing tide. These tides have been known to
reach over six feet high and move at the rate of about 10 knots. This spot
has also become a favorite spot for wind surfers as it offers some of the
best windsurfing conditions. Windsurfing in Alaska is rather expensive and
requires a good "dry suit", since the water is just slightly above freezing. A
dry suit is designed to completely keep the moisture off the body. This
area is only for experienced wind surfers since the tides coupled with the
dangers of the mud flats can be quite dangerous, even though the water is
only about 3 feet deep in places. During the summer, it is not unlikely to
see windsurfers from the tracks!
MP 89-75 BELUGA WHALES
In the water, be on the lookout for Beluga whales. Belugas are white whales
11-16 feet long, weighing about 2,000 lbs. when full grown and live up to 40
years.
In fact, the common name “beluga” was originally derived from the Russian
word for white, which is, “belukha”. When we see the Beluga whales, they
don’t breach, or jump out of the water. They just roll up out of the water to
take a breath of air, so we only see their backs. The beluga whale has
developed many adaptations that differ from other whales to better suit
the environment they live in. They are not as sleek as their cousins the
dolphin, due to the presence of a blubber layer that can be as much as 5
inches thick. Also a small beak characterizes their head and a bulging
“melon” shaped head that is quite agile compared to other whales. In fact
the Beluga whale is the only whale that can bend its neck. These features
are probably an advantage when maneuvering and catching prey in muddy
or ice covered water. Belugas have been known to live up to 60 years! Bald
Eagles are also prevalent along Turnagain Arm, especially during low tide.
Be sure to shout out if you see whales or other wildlife.
MP 91.7 WINDY POINT
(One of the first great places to look for Dall sheep)
A Fjord is a long narrow inlet with steep sides/cliffs. It’s created by glaciers
carving out a broad U shaped valley. This differs from the V shaped valley
formed by river action. In the case of Turnagain arm it is filled with glacial
sediment instead of ocean. This area resembles the coast of Norway and
Greenland.
MP 94 HOPE & SUNRISE ACROSS INLET (Right SB, Left NB)
(If you look hard across the inlet you might see part of Hope)
Across the Turnagain Arm you will find the historic town of Hope (Alaska’s
first gold-rush town!) and the Sunrise gold mining district which were
founded in 1895. This area is close to the very first discovery of gold in
Alaska by the Russians in 1849, when Peter Doroshin reported gold on the
Kenai River. The city of Sunrise once had a booming population of over
3,000 people. However, currently there are only about two-dozen people
who live there.
25
The city of Hope is approximately one mile from the Resurrection Creek
where gold was first discovered in Alaska, (a few years before the Klondike
gold rush), and currently has about 140 residents. In 1889 gold miners were
desperate to find a good name for their fast growing prospector
community. They decided that the youngest person to step off the boats
coming into the area was going to be who they named the town after.
Finally, 17 year-old Percy Hope arrived, and the rest is history! There is a
popular hiking spot over by Hope called Resurrection. This trail system
begins in Hope and is a very popular 33-mile weekend excursion for hiker.
(Give folks an idea of the scale of the scenery surrounding them. The mouth
of the Arm is approx. 5 miles in width and average height of the peaks in
the Chugach and Kenai’s is 4500 ft.)
MP 95 BELUGA POINT (Right SB, Left NB)
This area was once used as a look out point for Beluga whales by the
Chugach Eskimo tribes who inhabited this area in Alaska's early years.
Native hunters would sometimes set up a “spearing tree” in which a larger,
sturdier, spruce tree was driven upside down into the mud, and the bottom
was used as a perch for the hunter to harpoon the whales from during high
tides. Fellow hunters in kayaks would finish the hunt using a type of lance.
This area has also been crucial to anthropologists who have been able to
track the early inhabitants of the Anchorage bowl. They have found that
humans occupied the area in three waves, the first in 3,000 BC, the second
in 2,000 BC, and the third and last at the start of the new millennium.
MP 97 MCHUGH CREEK FIRE (Left SB, Right NB)
As we make our way along the Turnagain Arm, you may notice several
highway pull-offs. Some of these pull-offs lead to trail systems of the
Chugach State Park. Late on the night of July 16th 2016, escaped coals from
an illegal fire pit just north of McHugh Creek parking lot set ablaze the
beginning of what would become a 778 acre wildfire. According to the
Alaska Division of Forestry, there were no designated fire rings, and the
illegal fire pit was just off the trail system. Nearby housing areas were
threatened in Rainbow Valley and Potter Marsh. Luckily, Mother Nature
assisted with wet, damp weather and no additional winds, which could have
easily aided the spread of the fire. Forestry officials will remind locals and
visitors alike that escaped campfires are very preventable by simply
dousing them with water and stirring the ground around the fire, continuing
this procedure until no heat remains in or around the fire pit. Unfortunately,
about half of the wildfires in Alaska each year are started on accident by
people, we ask you to please help us preserve our beautiful environment
by making sure if you go camping or hiking that your recreational fire pits
are properly tended too, so that all may enjoy these and other state
parks.
22
MP 98-90 DALL SHEEP
For the next several miles be on the lookout for Dall sheep climbing on the
rocky cliffs to the 3:00 side. Dall Sheep are the only wild sheep in the
world. The rams (males) weigh about 300 lbs., while the ewes (females)
weigh about 150 lbs. Dall Sheep are herbivores and they have two-toed
hooves, which enables them to move well on rough, uneven ground. During
the summer when food is abundant, the sheep eat a wide variety of plants.
The winter diet is much more limited, and consists primarily of dry, frozen
grass and sedge stems available when snow is blown off, lichen, and moss.
It is quite common for people to confuse Dall sheep with Mountain Goats;
however, they have some very distinct differences. The Dall Sheep have

horns that can reach a full curl or more and the thick white hair on the
animal is very coarse and short; the Mountain Goat has short, almost
22 https://akfireinfo.com/tag/mchugh-creek/
26
spiked horns, and their hair is quite long. Mountain Goats also prefer
higher elevations than Dall sheep.
MP 100.5 POTTER SECTION HOUSE (Left SB, Right NB)
The Potter Section House built in 1929, on the 3:00 side of the tracks has
recently been restored and is a State Historical Site. This former railroad
section house is currently home to the Chugach State Park Headquarters.
You will see alongside the Potter Section House two old pieces of railroad
equipment. The gray one is a troop transport car from the 1940s and the
black one is an old rotary snowplow.
MP 102 MT. REDOUBT (Right SB, Left NB)
(FYI – Mt. Redoubt is visible on clear days. When it is out, look across Cook
Inlet and you’ll see the silhouette of a lone mountain, let passengers know,
otherwise they think it is Denali).
To our 9:00 side, across Turnagain Arm, we can see Mt. Redoubt. At just
over 10,000 ft. this is the 3rd highest active volcano in Alaska. Alaska is
part of the “Ring of Fire” surrounding the Pacific Ocean. Mt. Redoubt
became active in December 1989, this was the first eruption since 1968, and
it erupted over 25 times until it quieted down again in June of 1990. This
series of eruptions was the second most costly in the history of the Alaska.
When Mt. Redoubt erupted; ash from the eruption covered this entire area
as well as Anchorage and parts of the Matanuska Valley. More recently, in
March of 2009, Redoubt erupted closing down the Anchorage airport,
rerouting flights to Fairbanks. Mount Spur, Redoubt, Iliamna and Augustine
are all volcanoes that reside along the west side of Cook Inlet and are
visible from parts of the Kenai Peninsula. These represent an excellent
example of subduction zone volcanoes.
There are 100 potentially active volcanoes in Alaska with Mt. Wrangell
being the tallest at over 14,000 ft.
*Subduction Zone Volcanism occurs when two plates converge on one
another. This means that one plate containing ocean bottom (the Pacific
Plate) descends beneath an adjacent plate (the North American Plate)
which consumes the ocean floor into the earth’s mantle.
23
This bending of the plate causes large depressions called Oceanic
Trenches, which are some of the deepest features on the earth’s surface! In
Alaska’s case, we have the “Aleutian Trench” The crustal portion of the subducting
slab (which moves underneath the other plate) contains significant
amounts of water as well as dissolved minerals. As the subduction slab
descends to greater depths it encounters greater temperatures and
pressures. Water then lowers the temperatures of the mantle causing it to
melt. The melted rock and water rise up to the surface causing volcanoes
parallel to the trench. The Pacific Plate is sliding underneath the stationary
North American plate resulting in uplift. The collision of these plates are
how the Alaska Range was formed! (Home of Mt. Denali) The Pacific Ocean
is shrinking and the Atlantic is expanding.
MP 102.8 POTTER MARSH (Left SB, Right NB)
(SB-Start this just as you first begin to see the marsh, as you want to be
able to talk about the section house before you pass it.)
We are now entering the Anchorage Coastal Wildlife Refuge, or more
commonly referred to as Potter Marsh Bird Preserve. This is one of the
most accessible and scenic wildlife viewing spots, and is a resting point for
the migratory birds that come into Alaska. In late May and again in August
this area is full of waterfowl stopping here on their migration north for the
summer or south for the winter.
https://www.np 23 s.gov/subjects/aknatureandscience/volcanoes.htm
27
If you have an extra day in anchorage you can take a walk out on the
boardwalk that you see. The boardwalk is a 1,500 feet long and is open
daily for locals and visitors to view the waterfowl, at times you might even
spot different species of salmon entering the estuary from the boardwalk.
Another interesting outing is the overlook at Flat Top Mountain. Beautiful
views of the Cook Inlet, Alaska Range and the city of Anchorage can be
seen from there. Construction of the railroad originally created this marsh.
By the early '70s it was destined to become the new sanitary landfill for the
city of Anchorage. At the time however, several Anchorage School District
teachers had begun bringing their classes here to observe the waterfowl.
When the students found out about the proposal to destroy this area to
create a landfill, they started writing letters to the legislators opposing this.
With the help of their teachers they were successful in preventing this
marsh from becoming a landfill and created what we now see today as the
Potter Marsh Bird Preserve. If you were curious to know where the landfill
actually ended up; well it ended up in a suburb of Anchorage called Eagle
River, about 15 miles north of Anchorage.
MP 105 FLYING CROWN AIRSTRIP (Right SB, Left NB)
(The airstrip goes by very quickly, so be sure and prep your passengers in
advance. Southbound, I’d suggest starting no later than when you pass the
cemetery on the 3:00 side. Northbound, start right after you finish your
Potter’s Marsh commentary.)
In a moment, on the 9:00 side, we will see the Flying Crown Airstrip, which
runs right through these folk’s backyards! This airstrip has been here for
almost 60 years. Although current city codes would not allow you to
construct a subdivision around an airstrip, these homes were built in early
1975 when no such codes were needed. Though there are city codes now,
these residents are luckily allowed to continue operating the airstrip under
what are called “grandfather rights”. Having an airstrip in your backyard is
not that uncommon in Alaska. Alaska is known as the "flyingest-state” in the
nation. Alaska has 6 times as many pilots per capita and 16 times as many
aircraft per capita. One reason for such a high number of pilots and planes
is that only 25% of Alaska's communities are accessible by road. Here’s a
little bit of trivia for you - though Alaska is 2 ½ times the size of Texas, or
about (365 million acres), our road system is smaller than the entire State of
Rhode Island. This leaves much of the territory in Alaska only accessible by
plane; thus the reason for such high numbers of pilots as well as aircrafts.
Also, only 30% of Alaska’s Highways are paved!
24
MP 105.5 ANCHORAGE SAND & GRAVEL (Right SB, Left NB)
To our 9:00 side you can see Anchorage Sand and Gravel. Every summer
the Alaska Railroad hauls over 2 million tons of gravel in support of
construction and capital projects throughout the state of Alaska. The sand
and gravel that you see here is transported by train from the Mat-Su Valley
north of Anchorage. This resource is used for building on marshy
landscapes due to permafrost, a frozen layer of ground under 85% of
Alaska's top soil. Gravel fill is needed in order to stabilize the ground for
building, used as an insulation layer to prevent thawing of permafrost and
sinking of structures.
MP 108 TOUR GUIDE INFORMATION
(Tour guide info can also be discussed after Trail glacier when switching
with another tour guide)
Some of you may be curious about my job as an Alaska Railroad Tour
Guide. The Alaska Railroad Tour Guide program started in 1980 with the
Anchorage and Fairbanks School Districts. The Alaska Railroad funds this
program with an instructor provided by the school district to teach an 11-
http://www.24 dot.state.ak.us/stwdav/
28
week program. Tour Guides that work on the railroad go through a
screening process and must meet several criteria including being a junior or
senior with a 2.5 GPA or higher. Then students, after successful completion
of the class, are interviewed to be hired by the railroad. Those that aren’t
chosen are provided assistance in an attempt to find other employment
within the tourism industry. At this time the Alaska Railroad has an
education partnership with the Anchorage School District, but it has
included Fairbanks and Seward in the past. This education partnership has
set the standard for many other education partnerships nationwide. If you
have any more specific questions regarding this program feel free to ask!
(Now is a good time to pass around your photo album/flora/fauna books)
*Try to make localized announcements for these so people are not
confused and/or the albums get misplaced
“Ladies and gentlemen, today I have brought with me a photo album of my
life in Alaska and a book about Alaskan plants and animals that I made
myself, to share with you. I will start the books at the front of the car. You
are welcome to take a look and ask any questions you might have. When
you are finished or if you are not interested in looking at them, please just
pass them to the person behind you so everyone who would like will have a
chance to see the books. Again, I’ll be starting my photo album and animal
book at the front of the car.”
MP 109 DIMOND
The area that we’re travelling past is call Dimond Boulevard. Dimond Blvd
is named after Anthony J. Dimond who was well known throughout Alaska
as Judge Tony Dimond. He came to Alaska following the Gold Trails of
Valdez. He gave unselfishly of his time to the cause of Statehood and the
building of a better Alaska. Tony Dimond knew Alaska as well as any man
living there and was part of the driving force that gave life to Alaska. He
impressively bridged the gap between pioneer and modern Alaska as he
was a prospector, miner, lawyer, statesman and judge. The tributes of
naming Dimond High School, Dimond Mall and Dimond Boulevard in his
honor are evidence of his popularity.
*You can start to see the Dimond Mall from the tracks soon, and might
mention that it is one of Alaska’s biggest malls boasting over 200 stores,
services, restaurants, movie theatre, and even an ice rink!
MP 111 SPENARD
This area of Anchorage we are currently traveling through is called
Spenard, named after Joseph A. (or more commonly) "Joe" Spenard, who
was an early homesteader. When the town of Anchorage was first
established, it was a "dry" town, meaning that absolutely no alcohol was
allowed inside the city limits. Joe Spenard decided to create his own
recreation area complete with alcohol and other entertainment here, which
back then, was right outside of the city limits! Joe took it upon himself to
blaze his way onto municipal maps by hacking a trail from Anchorage
through the wilderness that carpeted the lower parts of Chester and
Campbell Creeks. Compared to many streets in Anchorage, which are
straight, and in a grid-like pattern, Spenard Road is very curvy. It is
speculated that the road was paved over the trail that the workers would
use to return home, after a wild night at Joe Spenard's! In reality though,
many of the streets are mostly paved over old game trails that animals
would use throughout this area.
MP 113 WESTCHESTER LAGOON/COASTAL TRAIL (Left SB, Right NB)
The bike path along the 9:00 depending on where you point it out) side of
the train is the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail and is a part of Anchorage's 128
29
miles of paved bike paths. Tony Knowles was our mayor of Anchorage for 2
terms between 1982 and 1987, he also served two terms as governor
from1994 to 2002. The 10-mile trail is extremely popular with runners,
walkers, cross-country skiers and bikers. It's not unusual to see a large
number of people out for a walk in the evenings enjoying the scenery or
even waving to the train from the Coastal Trail. To our 3:00 side, we can
see Westchester Lagoon. In 1978, the city of Anchorage put in control
gates, which created this beautiful freshwater lagoon. This area is the
western end of the Chester Creek Greenbelt. The greenbelt is a strip of
wilderness approximately half of a mile wide that runs through the entire
city of Anchorage from east to west. There are numerous recreational bike
trails, ponds and picnic areas throughout the greenbelt.
WILDLIFE
Throughout our trip today be on the lookout for wildlife, sometimes we see
them right here in Anchorage. We have a great system that we use in order
for you to have the best opportunity to see wildlife. Our engineers,
operating the train, will often be the first to spot wildlife along the tracks. If
they are able to, they will radio the onboard staff, such as me, as to what
animal we can look for and which side of the tracks it is currently on. We
will do our best to relay this information to you as quickly as possible,
however, please remember that the loud noises from the train sometimes
startle the wildlife and they may run quickly into the brush. The best plan is
to always have your eyes peeled and cameras ready, as you may only have
seconds to take a photo!
PICTURES
We want everyone to have an opportunity for a great picture. If you wish
to take pictures from the comfort of your seat here are a few tips. Make
sure your flash is turned off to reduce “flash back” off of the glass. Place
your camera directly against the glass to reduce or eliminate reflection.
CLOCK POSITION/RELATIVE BEARING
The train can be pointed in any direction at any time, not necessarily due
north or south. The clock numbers are relative to the direction in which the
train points. The observer then measures or observes the angle made by
the intersection of the line of sight to the longitudinal axis, the dimension
of length, of the train, using the clock analogy. A quicker relative bearing is
“Left” or “Right”, but you can use clock position for more specific direction.
MP 114.3 ANCHORAGE TRAIN DEPOT
Anchorage was established in 1914 as a railroad construction port for the
Alaska Railroad, which was built between 1915 and 1923. Ship Creek landing,
the headquarters for the railroad, quickly became a tent city. As you look
around, can you imagine that there were over 3000 white tents set up in
this area at one time? It wasn’t until November 23, 1920 that “tent city” was
incorporated into a city and officially named Anchorage. It is now home to
around 295,000 people; about 40% of the state’s population25. The city of
Anchorage has a moderate climate in comparison to other places around
the state. The average temperature in July is around 65 degrees, and the
average in January is around 20 degrees.
MP 117 JBER - JOINT BASE ELMENDORF-RICHARDSON
Originally this base began as two separate bases; Elmendorf Air Force
Base, and Ft. Richardson Army Post. Both bases were constructed in the
1940’s, however they merged in 2010. These bases were built because of
the threat of World War II. Six months after Pearl Harbor was attacked in
1941, Dutch Harbor (located on the Alaska Peninsula) was bombed. On
25 http://live.laborstats.alaska.gov/pop/
30
June 7, 1942, the islands of Attu and Kiska (both in U.S. territory on Alaska’s
Aleutian Chain), were invaded and occupied by Japanese forces. This was
the first time since the War of 1812 that an invading army had occupied
American soil. Elmendorf played a major supporting role in the efforts to
reclaim the islands of Attu and Kiska. The battle of Attu Island was fought
from May 11th through May 30th, 1943. It was the only land battle fought in
arctic conditions between the US and Japan. The battle of Attu had one of
the highest US casualty rates of any battle in WWII. The US services
embarked from California and had been trained and equipped for desert
warfare. Upon arriving on Attu Island, the weather was harsh, wet, cold,
windy, and treeless. Therefore, weather caused more casualties than the
actual combat itself. By August 1943, all enemy forces had been expelled
from the islands. However, many of the service men stationed here during
the war returned afterwards to make their home in Alaska. After both
Elmendorf Air Force Station and Fort Richardson Army Post were joined in
2010, the combined bases became known as JBER; “Joint Base Elmendorf-
Richardson”.
MP 127.9 EAGLE RIVER (Right NB, Left SB)
Shortly we will be crossing over the Eagle River, which flows from the Eagle
Glacier. If you look to our (3:00NB/9:00SB) side you will see some
buildings and homes nestled in the Chugach mountain range and the
surrounding valley. This is the community of Eagle River and has a
population of around 30,000 residents. Though Eagle River is located
several miles outside of Anchorage, it is actually part of the Anchorage
Municipality. Many residents commute to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson
for work. Several even smaller communities farther north in the
municipality include Chugiak, Birchwood, and Peters Creek.
MP 130 TOUR GUIDE INFORMATION
Some of you may be curious about my job as an Alaska Railroad Tour
Guide. The Alaska Railroad partners with the Anchorage School District,
which has set the standard for many other educational partnerships
nationwide. The criteria to apply for the Alaska Railroad Tour Guide
program includes being a junior or senior in high school, and obtaining a 2.5
GPA or higher. Once accepted into the program, students will attend an 11
week training course that takes place after school for two hours. Once they
have successfully completed the class, they will apply for a tour guide
position at the Alaska Railroad, in which only 10-15 students will be
selected. Students who do not obtain a position at the Alaska railroad are
provided assistance to find employment within the local travel and tourism
industry. The Alaska Railroad Tour Guide program started in 1981 with the
Anchorage and Fairbanks School Districts. The Alaska Railroad funds this
program with an instructor provided by the school district to teach the 11
week program. Students will receive a semester credit for this class, as well
as life-long public speaking and job interview experience.
Now’s a good time to pass around your photo album/flora/fauna books.
MP 136 BIRCHWOOD (Left NB, Right SB)
(In the early part of the summer, before all the leaves have opened up,
Birchwood Air Strip is pretty easy to see. Come mid-summer, you’ll only be
able to see it looking back as you cross the road.)
Here we will be traveling through one of our rail yards. On the (9:00NB/
3:00SB) side, you may be able to see a runway. This is the Birchwood Air
Strip. Alaska is known as the "flyingest-state” in the nation. Alaska has 6
times as many pilots per capita and 16 times as many aircraft per capita
when compared to the rest of the U.S. One reason for such a high number
of pilots and planes is that only 25% of Alaska's communities are accessible
by road. Here’s a little bit of trivia for you - though Alaska is 2 ½ times the
size of Texas, or about (365 million acres), our road system is smaller than
31
the entire State of Rhode Island. This leaves much of the territory in Alaska
only accessible by plane; thus the reason for such high numbers of pilots as
well as aircrafts. Also, only 30% of Alaska’s Highways are paved!
26
MP 138 KNIK ARM (Left NB, Right SB)
Out of the 9:00NB/3:00SB side of the train we have a nice view of Knik
Arm and the Knik Flats. Knik Arm is the northern portion of the Cook Inlet,
with the Turnagain Arm being the southern portion. The water you see out
here is a “brackish” mix of saltwater and fresh water, depending on the
tides. The tides here are among the highest in North America, the
difference can sometimes reach up to 40 feet.
MUD FLATS (Left NB, Right SB)
Looking out at the Knik Arm when the tide is out, you can see how it looks
muddy. Here, the accumulation of glacial silt has built up into what we call
the mud flats. These mud flats can be very dangerous for unsuspecting
explorers and fisherman. At low tide the silt compresses, becoming very
hard. As the tide makes its way back in, seawater filters up through the
lower layers. The silt changes quickly from what might seem like a hard
solid mud, to a quick sand. That makes for a very dangerous situation. The
best policy for anyone to follow is to stay off the mud flats. (Insert an
appropriate personal story if you have one.)
MP 141 EKLUTNA
We are now reaching the northern boundary of the Municipality of
Anchorage. Not too far from here is the native village of Eklutna, which is
named after the Eklutna River. The village which is called Eklutna was first
settled several hundred years ago, and is the oldest inhabited location in
the Anchorage area. The native corporation here is the largest private
landholder in the Anchorage Municipality and is one of the wealthiest.
Eklutna Inc. owns over 136,000 acres of land and is part of the Cook Inlet
Regional Native Corporation, made up of primarily Dena'ina Athabaskan
Indians. By the mid-1800's Russians had explored most of Alaska including
South Central where we are now. Their interest here was primarily the rich
fur resources of the region, especially sea otters and fur seals. The
Russians also brought to the new land; their customs, religion, and
language. One of the foremost legacies of the Russian period is the
Russian Orthodox Church, which remains a vital aspect of Native culture
throughout Alaska.
MP 146.4 KNIK RIVER
Soon we’ll be crossing over the Knik River, which flows from Knik Glacier.
Knik means fire in the Athabaskan language. Some say they called the river
“fire” because it looks like the water is ready to boil. After the Knik River,
we will be crossing over four different forks of the Matanuska River, which
flows from the Matanuska Glacier. The Matanuska River Valley separates
the Chugach Mountain range from the Talkeetna Mountain range. These
are just two of the 39 mountain ranges we have here in Alaska. The
predominant peaks on the 3:00NB/9:00SB side of the train are from left to
right/tallest to shortest: Pioneer Peak (6,394 ft.); East and West Twin Peaks
(5,873 ft. & 5,472 ft.) and Goat Rock (5,250 ft.); all of these are popular for
climbers.
On a nice day- Point out Mt. Susitna across the inlet (Sleeping Lady). Look
out for moose along the flats and prepare passengers for photo
opportunities. This is a good place to remind passengers how to use the
clock face system.

MP 148 PALMER HAY FLATS
Currently we’re traveling through the Palmer Hay Flats which is a State
Game Refuge encompassing 28,000 acres. It is home to many different
types of waterfowl, mammals and fish. This is a saltwater marsh and a
staging area for migrating birds as they make their way towards their
breeding grounds in the interior of Alaska and other portions of the state.
(Point out the three mountain ranges visible; the Chugach Mountain Range
to the 3:00NB/9:00SB side & behind you; the Talkeetna Mountain Range in
front and the Alaska Range across the Knik Arm from us)
MOOSE (Seen frequently between Knik River and Palmer cut-off)
As we travel along the river banks and open landscape through this area,
be on the lookout for moose. Moose are herbivores that eat leaves and
twigs of willow, birch, and aspen trees, along with pond weeds, and grasses.
They are the largest member of the deer family. The Alaska-Yukon moose is
the largest moose in the world! Adult moose can range in size from a small
800 pound adult female, to a large 1,600 pound adult male. They can reach
heights up to almost 6 feet tall. Bull moose are often easily recognized by
their antlers, which are carried only by the males. Adult males engage in
the “rut” in late September and early October. Females, or “cows”, give
birth to calves in the spring. Calves are weaned in the fall at the time the
mother starts breeding again, and they usually get chased off just before
she gives birth again in the spring.
OSPREY (Seen around Palmer cut-off and MP 162/173)
Soon, on the 3:00NB/9:00SB side, we will pass by a large nest of the
migratory osprey. Osprey are identified as raptors, with a wingspan of 5 1/2
ft. weighing in at 3 lbs. as adults. Male and female birds both assist in
building their nests, which have an average size of 3-6 ft. in diameter.
Osprey nests can be seen on trees, posts, towers, rock points, telephone
poles, and old telegraph poles. We see several osprey nests along the rail
belt, and since they mostly hunt for fish, we commonly see them in the
marshy wetlands.
Osprey migrate to Mexico and Central and South America during the
winter. In mid-May, females lay 2-4 eggs. Both adults will take turns
incubating the eggs until they hatch after 5-6 weeks. In mid-August,
nestlings begin flapping exercises. Keep a look out for osprey flying nearby,
or perched in the nests on top of towers and telephone poles, in these
areas.
MP 151 MATANUSKA
This valley we are traveling through is called the Matanuska-Susitna Valley,
or Mat-Su Valley for short. This valley is home to some of the best
agricultural land in North America. This is due to long hours of daylight
during the summer and the extremely fertile soil. Farming prospers here
with potatoes being the largest crop. Cabbage, zucchini, broccoli,
cauliflower, carrots, and peas are also grown here and find their way to
supermarkets around the state. The growing season averages 110 days,
with up to 19 hours of daylight on the longest day (June 21st). At the end of
August, the Alaska State Fair is held in the town of Palmer where one of
the traditional attractions is the giant vegetables. In 2012, the first-prize
cabbage tipped the scales at 138.25 pounds and set a world record! This
area also played a crucial role in Alaska's early development. In the 1930's,
word had gotten back to the Federal government about the agricultural
potential in the Mat-Su Valley. In 1935, under the “New Deal”, the
government invited 201 financially strapped families from places like
Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan, to the Mat-Su Valley. Each family
received 40 acres and was required to have 10 acres cut and cleared within
one year or they would lose the land. The Government built houses and
33
barns and agreed to pay for transporting up to 2,000 pounds of their
household goods to Alaska.
MP 155.4 GRAVEL PITS (Left NB, Right SB)
Speaking of crops, sand and gravel is actually the largest cash crop for the
Mat-Su Valley. The reason for this is because much of the ground in the
Anchorage area is marshy, and in order to stabilize the ground for building,
gravel fill is needed. Most of this “fill” comes from the Mat-Su Valley; gravel
is also used in construction in areas that are affected by permafrost. This
area used to have a spur track to an old gravel pit. In fact, you may notice
that we travel by a number of gravel pits along our journey. The Alaska
Railroad hauls up to 2 million tons of sand and gravel within the state every
summer.
MP 156 NORTHBOUND Give prep for Wasilla here
If Wasilla is your destination now is the time to start gathering your things,
returning your seats back to the upright position, and throw away any trash
that may have accumulated in your area. If Wasilla is not your stop then we
ask that you please remain seated and keep the aisle ways clear. Again, this
is just a quick stop, if this is not your destination, we ask that you please
remain seated.
MP 157 STEAM LOCOMOTIVE RESTORATION 557 (Left NB, Right SB)
Soon on the (9:00NB/3:00SB) side we will be able to see the warehouse
where the volunteers are restoring Steam Locomotive #557. The volunteers
are often outside waving to us beneath the Alaska Railroad 557 Restoration
sign. Even though the railroad switched over to diesel-electric locomotives,
steam locomotives were used to cross flooded areas when the newer
diesel locomotives were unable to. In June of 1962, this locomotive was
briefly brought back to service during flooding in Nenana. The steam
locomotive was able to ford high water over the rails, something the diesel
locomotives were unable to do. The 557 was built by the US Army
Transportation Corps in 1944 and was used until 1959. There were 2,120
made, 12 of those sent to Alaska. Eventually in 1964, 20 years after its arrival
in Alaska, it was sold to a scrap dealer in Washington State who also owned
a museum. So the locomotive avoided the scrap yard and shuttled school
children around and was known as a Gypsy Rose. The restoration is still
underway and is made possible by private donations and volunteer work. If

you would like to support the efforts to restore this piece of Alaskan
history, you can make a tax-deductible donation to The Alaska Community
Foundation. Any donations of $25.00 to $350,000.00 will be matched
dollar-for-dollar by the Rasmussen Foundation. In addition, if you purchase
any of the 557 locomotive merchandise in the railroad gift shops, the
proceeds will go towards restoration. If you have any questions on how you
can help out, please feel free to ask any of your onboard staff today.
WASILLA DEPOT
Shortly we will be passing the Wasilla train Depot, this is one of the last
remaining original depots along the Alaska Railroad. This depot was built in
1917 by the Alaska Engineering Commission and in 1977 was listed on the
U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The building itself is no longer
used as a depot to purchase tickets. It now houses the Wasilla Chamber of
Commerce. The other original depots are in Seward, Palmer, and Nenana.
MP 159 WASILLA / WASILLA LAKE (Right NB, Left SB)
Right now we are traveling through the city of Wasilla. Wasilla has a
population of around 10,500 residents, making it the fourth largest city in
Alaska. It is part of the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, which has a population
of roughly 107,600. Wasilla was named after a Dena’ina Indian, whose name
34
was Chief Wasilla. Shortly on the 3:00NB/9:00SB side of the train you will
see Wasilla Lake. This is a very popular recreation lake in both summer and
winter. In the summer, you’ll see people swimming, and other recreational
activities. In the winter, when the lake freezes over, people enjoy ice
skating, and ice fishing. Wasilla is also known for being the home of the
“Last Great Race”, the Iditarod Dog Sled Race to Nome, and the Tesoro
Iron-Dog the world’s longest snow machine race. The Iditarod Race
headquarters and the Iditarod Museum are both located here in Wasilla.
MP 159.5 WASILLA
Wasilla was known as Knik until 1917 when the Alaska Railroad made its way
through the Mat-Su Valley and crossed the Carl Wagon Trail, connecting
the community to the rest of Alaska. The trail was used to bring supplies to
the old Willow Creek mining district in the early 1900’s. The mining district
produced over 620,000 ounces of gold worth over 18 million dollars. Today
only a few of the 50 original mines are still active.
MP 163 NB/165 SB MUSEUM OF ALASKA TRANSPORTATION AND
INDUSTRY
Keep a close look out on the left (NB)/right (SB) for a quick look at the
Museum of Alaska Transportation and Industry. If you are interested in
learning more about the history of Alaska, I encourage you to visit this
museum. They have historical displays of the different ways people used to
travel around the state, to include rail coaches, a retired caboose, railroad
spikes, and tools. You can also view the display of old airplanes used in
WWII.
MP 163 SOUTHBOUND, Give prep for Wasilla here
(Once your new passengers are onboard, you’ll need to introduce yourself
and give them the appropriate safety and general train information. Do not
use the P.A. for this, just talk to them in person.)
MP 175 MT. SUSITNA (SLEEPING LADY) (Left NB, Right SB)
To many in southcentral Alaska, the most prominent mountain across Knik
Arm is Mount Susitna, or the “Sleeping Lady.” Local legend says that the
sleeping lady came from a race of giants. She laid down after her husband
went to war, and she will supposedly awake when there are no more wars.
This legend is often said to have Alaska Native origins, however, it appears
to have been created by settlers in the 1930s as a quaint story to tell
visitors and newly arrived locals. To the Dena'ina, Mount Susitna is known
as Dgehlishla, (Duh-lee-shla) meaning “little mountain,” contrasting with
another mountain on the horizon: Dghelay Ka'a, “Big Mountain,” or Denali.
Dghelishla was an important place for the Dena’ina. The western slopes of
the mountain were a place of mourning to remember the departed. The
mountain was also used as a prominent landmark to help guide the
Dena'ina as they travelled throughout Upper Cook Inlet.
27
Mt. Susitna is 4,379 feet high and is a formation called a pluton. A pluton is
a body of intrusive igneous rock (called plutonic rock) that is crystallized
from magma slowly cooling below the surface of the Earth. This particular
pluton was formed over 144 million years ago when a molten magma bubble
rose to the earth’s crust, but did not erupt to the surface forming a volcano;
the bubble instead cooled to form granite rock. Later glaciers and ice
sheets flowed over its summit and gave it a rounded smooth appearance. It
is estimated then the ice in the Cook Inlet was over 3,000 feet thick.

MP 175.3 HOUSTON (Left NB, Right SB)
The area we are passing through is called Houston. It was named for
Congressman William Cannon Houston, Chairman of the Committee on
Territories, who processed the Alaska Railroad Bill in the House of
Representatives in 1917. This area is also where the Port Mackenzie Rail
Extension will connect to the mainline, and you can see the construction of
the new line off to the left NB/right SB side. The 32-mile rail extension will
support Port Mackenzie’s potential as a bulk resources import and export
and facility. With room for layout and storage, the port is an ideal site to
supply materials for pipeline and other construction projects. Today, the
tourism industry and fishing activities associated with the Little Susitna
River support this small town.
· The City of Houston is located on the George Parks Highway along the
Little Susitna River.
· Houston is 18 miles north-west of Wasilla, 57 road miles, and approximately
61 rail miles north of Anchorage.
MP 180.7 NANCY LAKE (Left NB, Right SB)
(Start talking about Nancy Lake when you see the long aluminum buildings
on the 9:00NB/3:00SB side.)
We are passing Nancy Lake which is a major part of the Nancy Lake
Recreation Area, which consists of over 130 lakes and ponds. This area is
too wet for farming, but is a very popular recreation and retirement area
for south central Alaskans. A popular activity in the summer is following
the canoe trails through the eight-mile chain of lakes in the Lynx Lake Loop.
In the early and mid-1900s this was the trailhead for Rainy Pass, which goes
through the Alaska Range and into the Iditarod and Kuskokwim Mining
districts. Nancy Lake was named by Franklin Lane, Secretary of the Interior
at the time the Alaska Railroad was being built. Secretary Lane fought hard
during WWI to keep resources available for construction of the Railroad.
Due to his efforts, he was asked to name a lake, and chose to name this
beautiful lake off to the (9:00NB/3:00SB) side after his daughter, Nancy.
MP 185.7 WILLOW (Right NB, Left SB)
Soon we will be entering the small community of Willow, home to 2,102
people and the official starting point of the Iditarod sled dog race. Willow
got its start in 1897 when gold was discovered in the nearby Talkeetna
Mountains. During construction of the Alaska Railroad, surveyors,
construction crews, homesteaders and other settlers came to Willow. By
1954, Willow Creek was Alaska's largest gold mining district, with total
production approaching 18 million dollars.
The town of Willow is famous for being the proposed capital of Alaska.
Our state capital is currently located in Juneau, on the Southeast
panhandle of Alaska. Many Alaskans believe that Juneau is too
inaccessible and too far away from the majority of the population to be the
location for something as important as our capital. Juneau is only
accessible by plane or boat, and the inclement weather in the area often
make even those methods difficult. Southeast Alaska is home to only 10%
of the state’s population, whereas the rail belt region from Seward to
Fairbanks is home to nearly 75% of the population. With the construction
of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in the 1970s, state revenues began increasing
dramatically. With all the money coming in, some people thought that it
was time to move the capital to a location more accessible to the majority
of the population of Alaska. Willow was chosen as the potential new
capital because it is between Anchorage and Fairbanks, (the two largest
populated cities in Alaska) and is easily accessible along the Parks Highway,
plus has plenty of room for growth. Surveys were completed in the early
36
80s, but by that time oil revenues had already begun to dwindle. In 1982,
the "Capital Move Initiative" was put to a vote, but Alaskans voted down
the initiative when it was announced that the capital move would cost 2.8
billion dollars! So today, Willow remains “the capital that almost was”. In
fact every few years, capital move initiatives still appear on ballots. (9
times since 1960)
IDITAROD STORY
The Iditarod Race, as we know it today, was started in 1973 by Dorothy Page
and Joe Reddington, Sr. they wanted a way to commemorate the mushers
of the original dash to Nome in 1925.
In the winter of 1925, the town of Nome, located on Alaska's northwest
coast, was hit with an outbreak of diphtheria, which could have turned into
a serious epidemic. In Nome, they did not have enough serum for the
number of people who had contracted the disease. An urgent appeal was
sent out for diphtheria serum. The only serum in Alaska was found in
Anchorage at the Alaska Railroad Hospital. The problem was getting it to
Nome in the shortest time possible.
Typically it took 25 days to get from Anchorage to Nome at that time of
year because ships could not get through the frozen Bering Sea and the
airplanes of 1925 were not yet equipped to fly in the severe winter weather
conditions. Mushing the serum all the way to Nome was considered, but it
was determined that the fastest way to get the serum to Nome was to
transport it from Anchorage to Nenana by way of the Alaska Railroad, then
by a sled dog team across the remaining 670 miles to Nome.
The Alaska Railroad promptly loaded the serum onto a train and sent it up
to Nenana. From there, 20 dog teams defied the elements, traveling day
and night at record speeds, relaying it to Nome in less than a week! With
the help of the Alaska Railroad, the brave mushers and dog teams, the
town of Nome was saved.
The Iditarod Race starts on the first Saturday in March of each year and
can be seen on national television. There is a ceremonial start in
Anchorage, then sled dogs are loaded into trucks and driven to Willow for
the official start the following day.

MP 186.9 HATCHER PASS ROAD / INDEPENDENCE MINE,
SKEETAWK RECREATION
(In this area, look for where the tracks cross the Hatcher Pass Road, which
heads east over the 3,900' pass and then down to Palmer and Wasilla. The
Independence Mine State Historic Park, a renovated gold mine, is on this
road. This popular recreation area is known for blueberry picking, hiking,
snowboarding, cross-country skiing and paragliding. Recently a group
called Hatcher Pass Alpine Xperience unveiled that after years of hard
work and fundraising they have put in the first ever ski lift up to Hatcher
28 https://iditarod.com/race-history/
37
Pass. They have named this lift Skeetawk, meaning “Where we all slide
down” In Dena’ina)
These marshy areas where there is an abundance of low-lying shrubbery
are where you’ll want to keep your eyes open for moose!! The moose find
an abundance of good food such as algae and plants that grow in the water
in these areas. If you see moose or other major forms of wildlife, please
remember to help us call them out, so everyone else in the car has a
chance to see it, too!
MP 188 GEOLOGY
As we pass through this area you can see a definite lack of mountains and
rock outcroppings, with the exception of the Talkeetna Mountains. This
area is a large outwash basin for old glaciers that originated in the
Talkeetna Mountains and the Alaska Range. All of the lakes, as well as the
marsh grasslands, are another example of how the geological processes
shaped this great land.
Glaciers at one time covered all of this area and as they retreated
approximately 9,000 years ago they left large blocks of ice that would
eventually melt and leave depressions that then filled with water. Some of
the grasslands and forested areas were formed when glaciers left higher
areas of sediment called drumlins. These did not collect water, and
vegetation developed. As the early vegetation grew, eventually it
decomposed and formed soils for the larger trees that you see today. The
way some of these grasslands developed was through a process known as
“eutrophication”. This is when dust and dirt accumulate in a lake and the
slow encroachment of vegetation shrinks the lake until nothing is left
except the marsh grasslands. Some of this land that still has a substantial
amount of moisture in it freezes and becomes permafrost. I will be telling
you a little bit more about permafrost in a short while. Eventually, in some
of the areas, the vegetation dies and becomes thick enough to support
heavier root systems and larger vegetation develops. You can see on some
of the edges of these marshes where the black spruce trees are slowly
making attempts to fill in the land.
MP 189 SOCKEYE FIRE
(In this area you may start to notice burnt spruce trees along the tracks –
this is a result of a the 2015 Sockeye Fire)
On June 14th, 2015 the beginning of a 7,220 acre wildfire was sparked from
two local Alaskan residents leaving their illegally burning brush piles
unattended near the tree line of their cabin.
Within a matter of hours, around 500 sled dogs and many residents from
the Willow dog-mushing community had to quickly evacuate north to the
town of Talkeetna, as the fire was burning so fast, it ended up igniting 6,500
of the 7,220 acres within a 24 hour time frame of its start. The destruction
of the fire caused parts of the George Parks highway to be closed down
between MP 63 and MP 80. E.M.T.s rode onboard the Denali Star trains for
three days while the fire was nearest to the tracks. This insured extra safety
precautions for passengers who may have experienced respiratory
complications.
Amongst warped train tracks, and a ghostly red fire retardant that was
sprayed onto the threatened spruce trees, the fire destroyed around 55
homes, numerous recreational vehicles, and private as well as public land.
The Sockeye fire was only part of the 5 million acres (or roughly the state of
Connecticut) that were burned in Alaska during the 2015 summer season –
by far the worst Alaska has seen yet. 3,500 smokejumpers, 10 hot shot
crews, numerous helicopters and other workers came from all over the
38
Lower 48 and Canada to help the 2,000 firefighters based in Alaska cover
the 31,000 acres that went aflame from the Sockeye Fire alone.
Besides folks not putting out fires properly, lightning strikes in the dry
Alaskan forests also contributed to the state’s wildfire issues. It did not help
that the month of May brought on the hottest temperatures on record (in
91 years of Alaskans keeping records), about 7 degrees above average. This
subsequently thawed the snow sooner, drying out the ground faster than
usual. Black spruce forests are highly flammable with dry lichens and moss
in abundance, and the sap can cause small explosions in the spruce tree
when hot enough.
Please help protect this young and beautiful frontier and our proud local
residents by abiding by all fire safety rules and regulations while you visit
Alaska.
MP 190.5 JOHNSON’S HOMESTEAD
As we travel throughout this area you will see many old homesteads and
scattered houses. While homesteading in the lower 48 ended with the
Federal Land Policy Act of 1976, Alaska was open to homesteading until
1986 (10 years later). Today 29 there is no land available for homesteading in
Alaska, although the Department of Natural Resources currently sells state
land through two programs. The first program is an annual sealed-bid
auction program for subdivided and surveyed lands; bidding is open first in
April for Alaska residents and then opened in May for all other bidders.
The second program is the Remote Recreational Cabin Sites program,
which is similar to homesteading, although there are no build-up
requirements for the Remote Recreational Cabin program.
MP 195 ARR HISTORY
As I mentioned earlier Anchorage owes its beginnings in 1915 to the Alaska
Railroad, but construction of the Railroad has a little more history behind it.
Let’s start the story back in 1867, that’s when The United States purchased
Alaska from the Russians for $7.2 million dollars. William H. Seward, who
was Secretary of State at the time, arranged the deal. Today we know that
the U.S. got quite a deal, but back then most folks thought the purchase of
Alaska was a big mistake because they thought Alaska was nothing but a
frozen wasteland. In fact, the purchase of Alaska was commonly referred
to as Seward’s Folly!
From 1867 to the turn of the century, Alaska lacked any reliable means of
transportation, meaning we had no reliable way to get our natural
resources to market. This hurt the growth of our economy greatly. Several
attempts had been made by private companies to build a railroad in Alaska,
but most ended in failure, due to high construction costs.
At the turn of the century many thought it outrageous that a territory over
two and a half times as large as Texas was without a railroad. Many people
thought that a railroad was so important to the development of Alaska, that
if the private sector couldn’t do it, the government should. Finally in 1914,
after extensive lobbying efforts, the Federal Government appropriated
funds to complete the rail line and created the Alaska Railroad. The
approved route originated in the deep-water, ice-free port of Seward, on
the Kenai Peninsula and extended north along Turnagain Arm, into the
coalfields of the Matanuska Valley and ultimately ended in the interior city
of Fairbanks. Construction of the Alaska Railroad was completed in 1923.
President Warren G. Harding came to Alaska in July of 1923 and drove the
golden spike in the town of Nenana commemorating the completion of the

Alaska Railroad. It took approximately eight years and cost $70 million, or
nearly $1 billion today. Interestingly enough, at the time of completion, the
combined populations of the three major towns on its route, Seward,
Anchorage, and Fairbanks were only 5,400 people.
The Alaska Railroad was of great value during WWII to transport military
personnel, civilians and equipment. However, due to heavy usage during
this time, it needed to be rebuilt. Part of this rehabilitation was to replace
old equipment. In 1944, the railroad bought its first two diesel engines to
start replacing the steam engines that had been used up until this time.
The last steam engine was sold in 1964.*
(The last steam engine used on the ARR was the 557 and was donated back
to the Alaska Railroad for restoration. The Railroad plans on using it for
tours and excursions.)
This was the first and only railroad built and run by the United States
Federal Government. In fact, the U.S. Department of the Interior ran the
Alaska Railroad until the 1980’s. In 1985, the State of Alaska bought the
Alaska Railroad for $22.3 million. Now a board of directors appointed by
the Governor of Alaska runs the Alaska Railroad.
MP 190-225 PERMAFROST
*(Look specifically for a large area of black spruce trees)
As we travel through this area you will see many swampy, bog-like areas.
These areas are known as muskeg and are created by permafrost.
Permafrost is ground that is frozen for at least 2 consecutive years.
Permafrost usually lays 4-6 feet beneath the surface and can be 2,000 feet
thick. Approximately 85% of Alaska contains permafrost. The frozen layer
of permafrost stops water from seeping far into the ground and creates the
swampy muskeg. Another sign of permafrost is the patches of black spruce
trees. Black spruce trees often grow on permafrost-affected areas where
other trees cannot, because their root systems extend outward instead of
down where the ground is too solid to penetrate. The permafrost does
stunt their growth so some of the small trees you are seeing are over 30
years old.
MP 206 GOOSE CREEK TOWER (Left NB, Right SB)
(This is a difficult landmark to spot, look for it at the 10-11 o’clock position
until you pass under the highway, then look at the 7-8 o’clock position. Don’t
bother continuing the story if the viewpoint is past.)
Built by Phillip Weidner, a lawyer and civil engineer in Anchorage, originally
it started out as a simple log cabin, which it still is at the base, but then had
the thought of building a house on top of a house. And so he did, but then
got to thinking maybe he could put another one on top of that. And so on
and so forth. Weidner says that most of the ideas for each piece of the
tower came from his head and he made them come to life. Right now, the
tower is 185 ft. tall, eight levels and eight decks where you can walk 360
degrees around, however it is still unfinished and has been for 15 years. It’s
challenging to build in such a remote area of Alaska, so a lot of the stories
were actually built on the ground and put into place by a crane. All that
remains to be done is the 360 degree platform decks on some of the levels,
put in all the windows, and add a plastic dome on top for watching the
Northern Lights. Eventually he will share the house with his children and
grandchildren. Weidner calls his structure simply “Tower” or “Goose Creek
40
Tower”, though much to his chagrin the tower is also known locally as the
Dr. Suess house.

MP 206.2 ARR & ROAD CROSSING: PARKS HIGHWAY
The majority of the trip on the Alaska Railroad parallels the George Parks
Highway, which connects Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska’s two largest
population centers. Construction of the highway began in 1959 but wasn’t
completed until 1971. The highway is maintained year round and was
named after George Parks, who was territorial governor of Alaska from
1925 to 1933. He was a very influential and active politician until his death in
Juneau in 1984 at the age of 101!
MP 206.6 MCKINLEY FIRE
In the next few miles, you will be noticing acres of burnt trees and
structures surrounding the rail belt. This area is where a large wildfire
occurred during August of 2019. According to the Anchorage Daily News,
the fire was “initially attributed to a tree toppling onto a power line”. The
“McKinley” fire began on August 17th , near milepost 91 of the George Parks
Highway. By the night of August 18th, 53 primary buildings, 3 commercial
structures and 84 outbuildings were destroyed from the fire. In total, the
fire stretched 3,288 acres by the time it was contained. It was named the
“McKinley” fire as it originated on McKinley St. on the northwest side of the
George Parks Highway.

MP 209 DENALI VIEW (Left NB, Right SB) (FYI – Be on the lookout to the
9:00NB/3:00SB side for Denali. If you see it, let people know about the
upcoming view at MP 224. From left to right side: Mr. Foraker (17,400 ft.),
Mt. Hunter (14,573 ft.), and Denali (20,310 ft.).
Commentary if Mountain is visible:
Off to our 9:00NB/3:00SB side, we have a spectacular view of Denali! At
an elevation of 20,310 ft., Denali is the highest peak in North America. The
mountain is actually so high that it creates its own weather. Because of this,
it is only around 33% completely visible on a crystal clear summer day, with
about a 40% chance of it being partially hidden by its own cloud system,
and a 25% chance of not being seen at all! So we are extremely lucky to

get such a great view today! In about fifteen minutes we will be coming up
to an even better viewpoint and slowing down for photos, so keep those
cameras out.
(Denali’s official height above sea level was officially recalibrated from its
original measurement of 20,320 ft. (1953), to 20,237 ft. in 2013 using a
remote-sensing technique (InSAR), and finally using GPS survey data for its
final measure in September of 2015 at 20,310 ft. On Sunday, August 30th
2015, Interior of Alaska Secretary Sally Jewell signed a secretarial order
with the approval of President Barack Obama before he visited Alaska to
officially re-name the tallest peak in North America from Mt. McKinley
(named after Ohio senator William H. McKinley in 1896 who was for the
gold standard) to its original native Athabaskan name, “Denali”)
Commentary if Mountain is NOT visible:
On a clear day, we would be able to see Denali from here, but
unfortunately with the cloud cover we will not be able to see it today. The
mountain is actually so high that it creates its own weather and because of
this it is only visible about 30% of the time in the summer.
MP 211 BRIDGE OVER MONTANA CREEK
Right now we are crossing over Montana Creek, which is a popular salmon
fishing area. Montana Creek is a fresh water stream, which flows into the
Susitna River. (FYI – Montana Creek is only open to fishing on Saturdays,
Sundays, and Mondays) The highway is not very far from here and when
the salmon are running, many people drive up to the campground and go
fishing here. They fish at the mouth of the river because as the salmon
travel up silt filled rivers such as the Susitna, they like to stop as they enter
fresh water and clean their gills out. The silt is irritating to the fish, as it
would be for us walking through a sandstorm. The Montana area was
settled by homesteaders in 1957. Today, many people use a small airstrip in
the area to leave for remote hunting and fishing trips.
Shortly, we will again cross over the Parks Highway putting the highway on
the west side of the train. On the east (out of sight) is the Talkeetna Spur
road, a 15 mile paved road that is the only road into Talkeetna.
MP 210-220 TRUMPETER SWANS
Today we will be traveling by many ponds, so keep your eyes out for
Trumpeter Swans. They are easily identifiable as they are the largest swan
in the world; they also have extremely long white necks and large white
bodies. Trumpeter swans live to be about 13 years of age in the wild and up
to 35 years of age in captivity. It is not unusual for a pair of swans to mate
for life. Swans nest on the ground near water, usually on small islands; and
they lay 5-6 eggs. The swans that we will most likely see along the rail belt
today are Trumpeter Swans, which have all-black bills. Trumpeter Swans
are one of the largest birds in Alaska. Another interesting fact about
Trumpeter Swans is that adult swans are flightless for about a month when
they molt their feathers in the summer. As a result, male and female
trumpeters molt at different times so one adult in a breeding pair will be
able to fly while the other stays with the young swans, which are called
cygnets.
MP 224 SUSITNA RIVER - BEST VIEW OF DENALI (Left NB, Right SB)
On the 9:00NB/3:00SB side is the best view of Denali that we have along
the rail belt, so be sure to get a picture! The river on the 9:00NB/3:00SB
side, which we have been following and will be for the next 40 miles, is the
Susitna River. Susitna River is an Athabascan name that means "Sandy
River” or “Silty River". The Susitna is over 300 miles long and empties into
Knik Arm of the Cook Inlet. Salmon migrate upstream for hundreds of miles
42
through this important river; they then enter one of the over 10 smaller
tributaries and continue upstream even farther before spawning. Salmon,
trout, grayling and Dolly Varden are all found in the rivers and creeks in this
area.
MP 225 TALKEETNA (Left NB, Right SB)
Shortly, we will be stopping at the town of Talkeetna, also known as the
"Real Alaska”, or “The Gateway to Denali". Talkeetna has a year-round
population of about 875 people. Downtown Talkeetna covers
approximately 3 square blocks. 13 of the 26 buildings here are listed on the
National Registry of Historic Places. Talkeetna has a variety of restaurants
and accommodations, and it makes a great destination for a day trip out of
Anchorage. Activities in Talkeetna include flight-seeing, riverboat tours, ziplining,
fishing charters, float trips, gold panning, museums, gift shops, and
art galleries.
The reason some people like to call Talkeetna the Gateway to Denali is
because most of the climbing expeditions to the mountain start from here
with a flight to the base of the mountain. The population of the town can
sometimes double in the summer, with the influx of mountain climbers and
visitors from all around the world. Denali is a mountain that many climbers
dream of climbing. The climb takes a great deal of preparation,
determination, and effort. It is one of the most challenging mountains in
the world, and is quite an accomplishment for those who succeed. It usually
takes around three weeks to reach the summit, and climbers ascend in
groups of two or three. Base camp is usually set up around the 7,000 ft.
level, and is often reached by a flight from Talkeetna. Denali is surrounded
by several other mountains peaks in the Alaska Range. When the weather
is cloudy, it is easy to think that one of the smaller nearby peaks is Denali.
However, on a clear day it is easy to see that Denali towers high above the
others.
The confluence of three major rivers is here, the Talkeetna, Chulitna, and
Susitna. Talkeetna is an Athabascan word meaning "River of Plenty". In this
area, the Talkeetna and Chulitna Rivers flow into the Susitna. You may
have noticed that many of the rivers have names ending with the suffix "na",
such as the Chulitna, Talkeetna, Susitna, and Chena. This is because in the
Athabascan language the suffix "na" means river or flowing water. After we
pass by “Beautiful Downtown Talkeetna”, we’ll cross over the Talkeetna
River.
MP 227 FAIRVIEW INN (Left NB, Right SB)
After we leave the depot, on the (9:00NB/3:00SB) side of the train, look
for the green and white colored Fairview Inn. This is the famous hotel
where President Warren G. Harding and his wife stayed on their return trip
from Nenana in 1923 when he drove the golden spike to commemorate the
completion of the Alaska Railroad. Three days after leaving Alaska, the
President became ill and died, and for many years rumor had it that he had
been poisoned at the Fairview Inn. It is now said that he died of a stroke,
but the Fairview Inn plays up its infamous reputation to the fullest and
today is still a popular stop for tourists as well as the “locals".
MP 234 SOUTHBOUND Give Prep for Talkeetna
(After your passengers have disembarked, there will most likely be a line of
passengers waiting to board. Politely let them know that you will begin
boarding shortly, but you must tidy up the car first. Now go through your
assigned coach(s) and bring all seatbacks forward, collect any trash on the
seats or floors and clean/restock your restrooms before boarding your new
passengers.) (Repeat Departure Announcements and don’t forget to
introduce yourself again!)
43
MP 233 DENALI VIEW (Left NB, Right SB)
Again out of the west side of the train we have a good view of Denali (if
weather permits). The mountain is still more than 60 miles away at this
point.
MP 236.2 CHASE/FLAG STOPS
You may see several trails leading from the tracks into the woods for the
next 50 miles or so. These trails lead to cabins and several small
communities. The area we’re traveling through now is called Chase, which
was named in 1922. Chase is home to approximately 40 year-round
residents who are devoted to self-sufficiency, and living a subsistence
lifestyle. One-third (1/3) of homes in this area have individual water wells,
septic systems and complete plumbing. The remaining two-thirds (2/3) haul
water and use outhouses. There is no central electrical system; and 80% do
not have telephone service. There is also no direct road access to Chase;
the only way for residents to get in and out other than by 4-wheeler or
snow machine is by the Alaska Railroad’s Flag Stop Service. The Alaska
Railroad offers a "Flag-Stop" commuter service, called the Hurricane Turn,
to people who live out in cabins in this remote area, it is called the
Hurricane Turn. They can flag down the local service train anywhere along
the route in both summer and winter. This flag-stop train service is the last
of its kind in the U.S. and one of the last in North America. The “Flag-Stop”
train runs 4 times a week in the summer from Talkeetna to Hurricane and
once a month in the winter from Anchorage to Hurricane. In the winter we
also offer the Aurora Winter Train that runs Anchorage to Fairbanks on
Saturdays and Fairbanks to Anchorage on Sundays.
32
MP 240 TELEGRAPH POLES/ACS
You may have noticed old telegraph poles to our (3:00NB/9:00SB) side.
We will be following these telegraph poles almost all the way into
Fairbanks, and if you were to ride the train to Seward you would see these
poles following the tracks along there as well. These poles were built
beginning in 1914 and were connected to an original telegraph system that
was built to connect Alaska to the lower 48 and was started in May 1900.
The first segment, from Eagle to Nome, was completed under the direction
of Lt. Billy Mitchell in 1903. The telegraph system became known as the
Washington Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS) and
was re-designated the Alaska Communications System (ACS) in 1936.
WAMCATS/ACS managed both military and civilian messages – in fact, in
1906, of the 300,000 messages being handled, only 1/5 were military in
nature.
Along the rail belt, there were 35-40 poles constructed per mile, with 1,890
poles built in 1918 alone! Before the Railroad had wireless radio
communications, train crews would use these telegraph poles to
communicate with the different railroad stations. To send or receive
messages, the conductor would reach out with a long pole that had a small
bit of wire on the end and connect the wired end to the telegraph lines.
ACS remained a military-run communications program until it was bought
by RCA in 1971 and re-named Alascom. Digital switching was introduced to
Alaska in 1989, and the last telegraph office in Alaska closed down in 1993.
There are three satellites dedicated to providing telecommunications in
Alaska. (The satellites were launched by Alascom in 1982, 1991, and 2000).
MP 244 ALASKA NELLIE
https://32 www.alaskarailroad.com/ride-a-train/our-trains/hurricane-turn
44
A story of Alaska and the Alaskan Railroad would not be complete without
the legend of Alaska Nellie. As the train tracks were completed farther and
farther north, Nellie moved with them. In 1919, she had a roadhouse at
Deadhorse (which eventually became Curry) at milepost 248.5.
When President Warren G. Harding came to Alaska in 1923 to drive the
golden spike and commemorate the completion of the Railroad, he and his
wife wanted to meet Nellie. He was very impressed by the caribou head,
musk ox hide, bear hides, moose heads and other big game trophies she
had on display.
Nellie eventually purchased the village of Roosevelt just north of Seward
which she eventually renamed Lawing. The wealthy and famous of Europe
and America stayed with her at her lodge while on hunting trips.
When her pet black bear, Mike, was found dead with a brown bear standing
over him, she chased down the bear and killed it. As she told it:
"One night I went out to my barn to feed my little pet black bear,
and I found he was missing. As I went out into the snow, a huge
shape lunged at me. I twisted away and ran to the barn. As I tried to
shut the door to keep the big brown bear out, he smashed at the
door with a paw, and it slammed shut on my fingers. I remained
inside for a while, and heard the bear catch and kill my pet. Then I
heard him drag the body away to bury it in a snow bank. I couldn't
stand it after that. I ran to the house, got my 30.06, and ran back.
He reared and started toward me and I had to shoot him six
times before he fell dead at my feet."
33
In 1938, after the death of her husband, Nellie toured the U.S. to promote
Alaska. She eventually was the subject of a film in 1940 and in 1941 wrote an
autobiography. Alaska Nellie died in 1956 and left behind a legacy of
stories about life in a remote and wild Alaska during the first operating
years of the Alaska Railroad.
MP 247 NB/ 250 SB Prep for Curry
I invite you all to take a step back in time, and in a few minutes we will be
going through a historic site that was once home to the Curry Hotel. This
area coming up, started out as a station for maintenance of way workers in
1923, the same year the Curry Hotel was constructed. The Curry Hotel was
Alaska’s largest and most luxurious hotel at that time. This hotel was
needed due to the fact that back then, we operated steam locomotives
that took two days to complete the 470 mile trip from Seward to Fairbanks,
so we needed a stopover point for our passengers to stay the night before
finishing the second half of their trip the following day. Upon its opening
the Curry hotel was built as “a palace in the wilderness where
accommodations were modern, inviting and comfortable with the highest
order cuisine.” The hotel was named after a Californian Congressman
named Charles F. Curry, who was the Chairman of the committee on
Territories and a heavy supporter of the Alaska Railroad in Congress.
In 1924, a 537 ft. long suspension foot bridge was built over the Big Susitna
River, giving guests access to a 5 mile trail that lead to a small hut on the
2600 ft. Curry Ridge known as the ‘Regalvista’ because of the magnificent
views of Denali. They also operated a 14 passenger gas car that would take
guests from the Curry Hotel, to the streams just south of the town of
Talkeetna, to fish for trout and grayling. Later on, the Alaska Railroad
outfitted this resort with tennis courts, basketball courts, a three-hole golf
course, a small pool, a bakery, a creamery, and a ski area with a tow rope
Alaska N 33 ellie by Nellie Neal Lawing (Seattle: Chieftain Press, 1940)
45
and a designated ski jumping area. Needless to say, Curry Alaska was
becoming a very popular resort town with more amenities than anywhere
else in the state.
The Curry Hotel did have its setbacks as it suffered from numerous fires. In
1926 the engine house and power plant were destroyed by fire when coal
dust came in contact with an overheated stack. The railroad rebuilt a new
engine house and power plant in two separate buildings right away. In 1933
that same engine house once again burnt down and was rebuilt. In 1945
the power plant burnt to the ground after a hand-fired locomotive type
steam boiler exploded due to low water in the boiler. And then the final
blow to the Curry Hotel happened on April 9, 1957 when the hotel caught
fire and burnt to the ground killing 3 people. At that point in time, the
railroad didn’t see the benefit in re-building the hotel as the railroad was
transitioning to diesel electric locomotives, which could make the trip to
Fairbanks in a single day.
MP 248.5 CURRY
***Point out where the ski hill is as well as the basketball hoop (you can still
see the backboard) on the East side (3:00NB/9:00SB) of the tracks, and the
hotel and the suspension bridge were located on the West side (river side)
of the tracks. Point out the old train consist with the rotary snow plow
locomotive on the front***
MP 253 GLACIALY-FED RIVERS
Looking at the Susitna River, you have probably noticed that the water
looks "dirty" or “murky”, this is due to the abundance of glacial silt in the
water. Glaciers have been called ‘nature’s bulldozers’ because as they
move down mountains, they carve out U-shaped valleys and also pick up
rocks and debris. Over centuries of ice buildup and movement, the debris
becomes pulverized into fine sediment. As the glacier melts this sediment
is suspended in the water and is what gives the water its murky, or dirty,
color. A glacier is formed when annual snow accumulation at the top of the
mountain or glacier is greater than the annual summer melt at the bottom
or terminus of the glacier. This causes the snow to compress itself forming
dense, very heavy ice that moves downward, aided by the forces of gravity.
Because of the great density of this ice, it absorbs all colors of light except
short wavelength blue light. As the ice melts the dense crystal structure
breaks down and reflects all the colors so it looks white. That is why you
will sometimes see the deepest blue in the new cracks and crevasses; the
ice has not had time to break down and is still very dense. The colors
sometimes appear the richest on cloudy days because the direct sunlight
makes the wet ice produce a glare making it hard to see the true colors.
Another interesting thing about glaciers that is commonly overlooked is
that a glacier exists for a much greater amount of time than any of the ice
within it. Remember, new ice is constantly forming in the zone of
accumulation, flowing downward and melting. So ice can cycle through a
glacier, while the glacier just gets older. The ice in a typical Alaskan glacier
is less than 100 years old, although glaciers have been in Alaska since the
last Ice Age (more than 10,000 years ago).
MP 257.7 SHERMAN CITY HALL (Right NB, Left SB)
Mary and Clyde Lovel arrived here in 1964. Mary lived with her 4 children
here while her husband was working down in Anchorage. Soon after, Clyde
was offered a job on the Alaska Railroad and was stationed in Gold Creek,
a few miles north of Sherman. With use of the Alaska Railroad, they were
able to bring building materials and supplies to this area to build the
structures you see now. While away on vacation in the early 70’s, a relative
painted the cabin including the words “Sherman City Hall” as a joke. The
46
Levels don’t live here year-round anymore but their children visit often.
Mary Lovel is also a published author
Some of her books;
• “Journey to a Dream”- This is a true story of the Lovel family and
their adventures moving to Alaska during the 1960's. Subsequently
homesteading land and building a life in the Alaska wilderness
that they enjoy to this day.
• “Suddenly It’s Spring” - A True Alaskan Adventure Story continued
• “Golden Sands of Nome (1-3)” - The adventures of a young girl
during the gold rush days a in Nome, Alaska early 1900's, forced
to fend for herself, due to circumstances beyond her control. This
novel is a fiction based on fact. The main characters in this book
are authentic people, ancestors of and related to the author
MP 264 BRIDGE OVER SUSITNA RIVER
This bridge over the Susitna River, which was originally built in 1921, spans
504', and is on the National Register of Historic Places. This was the first
steel bridge built on the Railroad and at the time it was the longest single
span bridge west of the Mississippi River. In 1923, however, the Mears
Memorial Bridge near Nenana was completed and that bridge spans 704'.
As we head north, we now leave the Susitna River, which we have been
following north. Upstream from here, it runs from east to west along the
northern edge of the Talkeetna Mountains.
MP 269 INDIAN RIVER
(Twin bridges just after first bridge - people fishing, tents)
We are now traveling through one of the most scenic areas along our trip.
The very clean and beautiful river out the 3:00NB/9:00SB side is known as
the Indian River, we cross this river 4 times total. The King Salmon
(Chinook) reach this river around the 4th of July, and throughout the rest
of the summer you can usually see salmon here. The green color of this
river is due to the deposits of copper that are oxidizing in the surrounding
hills. All species of salmon, except Red Salmon (Sockeye), run up the Indian
River. This is because Red Salmon need a lake system to spawn in. You can
also fish for trout, Dolly Varden and grayling here. One of the best things
about fishing here at Indian is that it is only accessible by the Alaska
Railroad so you don't encounter the combat fishing that happens in other
area rivers.
(Watch for grizzly bears in this area; they are always around!)
MP 271-273.5 SHANNON CARTWRIGHT/BUTTERFLY FLAG
(Right NB, Left SB)
This is the flag stop for a very talented and well-known local author and
illustrator, Shannon Cartwright. Shannon came to Alaska in 1972, but to
truly understand her life and work, I’d like begin her story when she was
just a kid living in Detroit, Michigan where she was born and raised…
Shannon’s grandfather lived right next to the Detroit Zoo, where he would
take her and her brother every weekend. (Interestingly enough, they rode a
small passenger train to get to the far side of the zoo!) She fell in love with
all the animals at the zoo, often painting, sculpting, and creating collages of
them!
Shannon’s grandmother was a public health nurse who would travel from
her home in Kotzebue, Alaska to as many as 75 different villages within the
state during the 1940’s and 50’s. She always had intriguing stories of
travelling by dog team and bush plane to get to her destinations through
the vast and rugged terrain. Her grandmother would send her unique
jewelry, toys, and dolls made with locally made ivory, fur, and animal hides.
47
She even wore a pair of mukluks to elementary school; boots made from
seal or caribou, that her grandmother sent her.
Unfortunately, Shannon’s grandmother never did have any children’s books
to send her from Alaska. As Shannon eventually became an illustrator for
Alaskan children’s books; she was well on her way to her purpose in life.
Joining forces with her good friend and local author Shelley Gill, the two
brought Alaskan wilderness and fun animal facts to life for many children.
Shannon has illustrated over 30 books that are educational as well. From
learning ABC’s, to mathematics, prehistory, and rhymes; teaching kids
about Alaska’s wonders is definitely a priority! Today, many Alaskans have
grown up and shared these stories and illustrations with their own children!
From sirens, traffic, and city lights; to train horns, wild life encounters, and
abnormal hours of daylight, we can see that Shannon is right where she was
always destined to be. For more than four decades Shannon has toughed it
out along the rails, as well as working in Bristol Bay on a set net site and
even wrangling horses and guiding pack trips in the Alaska and Brooks
mountain ranges…all in the wilds of Alaska. Her closest neighbors are
moose, trumpeter swans, and even wolf packs and grizzly bear!
Today, Shannon lives here year-round with her partner, a local friend and
handyman. She also lives with her canine partner, Ella. Keep an eye out and
you may just see her waving from her flag stop or art gallery here in
Chulitna!
Some of her books;
• “Finding Alaska” – A story of Shannon’s journey to this beautiful
state she calls home, highlighting some of her inspiring artwork
and illustrations through the years …
• “O’l 556” – How an Alaskan steam engine saves the day! A true
story intertwining past and present railroad history and fun facts
for all ages!
• “Alaska’s Animals You and I” – Shannon’s first book to come out in
8 years after she had surgery for a medical disability, which had
rendered her unable to draw or paint – this book celebrates
diversity of animals and people around the world!
• “Thunderfeet” - Discover Alaska's dinosaurs when you travel back
through prehistoric time in Thunderfeet. Take a trip through 70
million years of history from the day of the dinosaurs to the
migration of North America's animals across the Bering Land
Bridge.
*Look for the butterfly flag, (her cabin trail), and the rainbow flag! (Her art
gallery)
Note: Shannon’s books, cards, and fine art prints can be found at the
Dancing Leaf Gallery in Talkeetna, (mention SB especially), and some of her
books are available in Alaska Railroad gift shops!
MP 270-280 BEAVER
This is another prime beaver area on our route; we see many beaver ponds
in this area. Beavers are North America’s largest rodents. They weigh on
average 40 to 70 pounds, but in Alaska have been known to reach as much
as 100 pounds. They reach about 3 to 4 feet in length including their tail, so
roughly about the size of a collie. They have an average life expectancy of
10 to 12 years, but have been known to live to 19 in captivity. Beavers build
ponds because it raises the water table of the environment. This creates a
safer environment for the beavers by putting more water between them
and their predators and brings a greater amount of food and building
materials closer to the water.
48
They usually build one main dam that holds back water about 4 to 8 feet
deep. Then there is a series of smaller staging dams; these are designed to
take some of the pressure off the main dam. The lodges and dams look like
large piles and walls of sticks, rocks, grass and mud. The lodges, which often
are very old, have grass growing over the top of them. Beaver families
build their lodges in the middle of the pond for protection while beavers
living on a river will typically have lodges built into the sides of the banks.
Beaver butts secrete a goo called castoreum, which the animals use to
mark their territory. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration lists castoreum
as a “generally regarded as safe” additive, and manufacturers have been
using it extensively in perfumes and foods for at least 80 years.
34
Contrary to popular belief, beavers do not eat fish; they actually eat the
bark of cottonwood, willow and alder trees. Beavers store their food at the
bottom of the pond. In winter, when the top of the pond freezes, the
beavers release some water through the dam and this creates an air pocket
between the top of the liquid water and the bottom of the ice. By doing
this, they don't have to go all the way over to their lodge to breathe.
Beavers also have flaps of skin that go behind their teeth so they can chew
under water. So once again, be on the lookout for signs of beaver!
MP 277 KODAK/FUJI CURVES (Left NB, Right SB) – Announce before you
get here
To our (9:00NB/3:00SB) side is a wonderful view of Denali.
(If Denali is not out, still point out where it would be and continue with the
commentary)
Of the 20 tallest mountains on the Continent, 17 are in Alaska. The North
and South Peaks and South Buttress of Denali, Mt. Foraker and Mt. Hunter
are all among these 20 tallest mountains and are all located right here in
Denali National Park. We have 19 peaks in Alaska that reach over 14,000
feet. Denali is surrounded by several other mountains and when the
weather is cloudy, it is easy to think that one of the smaller ones is actually
Denali. However, on a clear day, it is easy to see that Denali towers high
above over the others:
South Peak of Denali 20,237'
Mt. Russell 11,670'
Mt. Foraker 17,400'
Mt. Hunter 14,570'
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/34 animals/article/beaver-butt-goo-vanilla-flavoring
49
Mt. Silverthrone, (north) 13,200'
Mt. Deception 11,800'
(Not all of these are always visible!)
11 Glaciers are spawned in the ice cap surrounding Denali and its
neighboring peaks. Three well-known glaciers are the Muldrow Glacier
(which you can see from the park), the Kahiltna Glacier (which is the most
popular climbing glacier), and the Ruth Glacier (which is the largest of
these glaciers).
At this point we are traveling on what has historically been known as the
Kodak/Fuji curves. The name came from all the Kodak and Fuji film that had
been spent on them. Now is a great opportunity to take a picture of the
train, as the Kodak/Fuji curves are both tight curves that will allow us to
see the front or the back of the train as it turns.
MP 279.5 GEORGE PARKS HIGHWAY
At this time we are crossing the George Parks Highway. This is as close as
we get to Mt. =Denali, which is 46 miles away and our current elevation is
approximately 1300’.
MP 284.2 HURRICANE GULCH
***Southbound, start this at Honolulu, Northbound start this as you pass
Hurricane Section House to give passengers plenty of time to get their
cameras ready.***
In just a few minutes we will be crossing Hurricane Gulch. This is definitely
something you will want to have your cameras ready for! It is the longest
bridge on the Alaska Railroad, spanning 914 feet and a 296-foot drop down
to Hurricane Creek below. Building this bridge proved to be one of the
most challenging aspects of the Alaska Railroad’s construction. The
American Bridge Company, which was also responsible for building the
White Pass Yukon Railroad near Skagway, Alaska, developed a plan that
would allow for the construction of this bridge. In 1921, an aerial tramway
was strung across the gulch and construction began on either side of the
gulch. The crews finally met in the middle in August of 1921. The name
Hurricane comes from the hurricane force winds which often blow through
the gulch. They have been clocked as fast as 90 mph! As we cross the
gulch out of the west side of the train, you will see a beautiful view of the
glacially fed Chulitna River. The train will slow down to 10 mph as we cross
the bridge so there will be plenty of time for pictures. Just, don’t all go to
the same side at once please.
287.7 BRIDGE OVER HONOLULU CREEK
Watch for salmon as we cross over the Honolulu Creek. This far up stream,
they will most likely have turned bright red from swimming in the
freshwater. Salmon are anadromous, they begin their lives in freshwater
lakes and streams and spend the majority of their lives in the ocean. Later
they return to the lakes or streams in which they were originally spawned
to spawn themselves. Upon returning to the freshwater, the salmon’s
bodies begin to decay as they cannot physically handle the dramatic
change in water salinity a second time, and they start to turn bright red.
Salmon fry (the term for tiny young salmon) vary in the amount of time they
spend in freshwater before they head out to the ocean to live. Pink Salmon
(Humpy’s) will spend less than a year in freshwater and complete their
entire life cycle in two years, whereas the Sockeye Salmon will spend up to
four years in freshwater before traveling out to sea, where they will spend
1-3 years maturing before returning.

MP 289 HONOLULU
E Komo Mai and Aloha, welcome to Honolulu, AK. The halfway point
between Anchorage and Fairbanks. Honolulu is said to have been named
in 1913 by a prospector searching for gold. Some speculate that his luck just
wasn’t… panning out, so to take his mind off his troubles he dreamed about
Honolulu. This is also the jumping off point for those heading into the
Broad Pass Mining District west of here.
(The river you see is NOT Honolulu Creek. Honolulu Creek is a clear-water
creek that the train crosses over at MP 287.7. The larger, mixed silt-clear
water river is the confluence of the Middle and West forks of the Chulitna
River. Honolulu Creek meets these two forks a little south of here.)
The ALASKA RANGE is still to your 9:00NB/3:00SB Side until Cantwell.
The TALKEETNA RANGE is to your 3:00NB/9:00SB side
MP (VARIES) PREP FOR MEET
Well, ladies and gentlemen, soon we will meet up with our train’s twin sister.
It left Fairbanks the same time this train left Anchorage, and in a moment,
we will stop side-by-side to transfer onboard staff. So, at this point I will be
leaving you and getting on the southbound train that will take me back to
home in Anchorage. I've enjoyed visiting with you today and hope the rest
of your stay in Alaska is WONDERFUL!!
It is vital that you give the above information so your passengers are aware
of what is going on, stay in your car as long as possible prior to meeting
and as soon as you meet trains go to your new car and introduce yourself
and walk through your car a number of times so passengers don’t wonder
where their tour guide is!
At a slow spot before this you should have gathered your belongings
together to be ready for the transfer. When the trains meet, the conductors
want a quick meet to get going again - DON'T BE THE CAUSE OF A
DELAY! If for some reason you travel beyond Broad Pass for the switch,
you must be familiar with the information. The following Mile Posts are
given for that reason. Adjust your commentary accordingly. The meet will
usually occur at Broad Pass or Colorado. Your supervisor or conductor will
inform you as to which. Ask your supervisor or the conductor for the MP
and location onboard the train where you will meet if you are unsure. If
meeting at Broad Pass, after you have ‘said your goodbyes’, give the
commentary for Broad Pass and let your passengers know how long it will
be before you get there. Also, if you know how long your train will be
stopped at the meet (for example, the conductor has told you that the other
train is 10 minutes away.) let your passengers know that they will be waiting
for a while (be general about the length of time) at the meet with the other
train. You might also explain that the ARR has only one main line if you
haven’t done so already.
Make sure the bathrooms in your car are clean and well stocked prior to
meeting trains!
MP 297 COLORADO
The houses we see here are part of the small town called Colorado. Roads
from Colorado lead to coal and gold mines in the area. As the train begins
to climb in altitude, the few scrubby black spruce trees are becoming
smaller. This terrain is commonly known as the "Taiga" or “land of little
sticks.” At the 2700' level the taiga will end and the tundra begins.
Here the dwarf flowers, mosses and lichen show off their best colors in late
spring when they bloom and again in late August as the fall colors change.
Begin watching for Dall sheep on the mountainsides in this area. Also, be
51
on the lookout for caribou, moose, grizzly bears, wolves, fox and other small
animals.
MP 304 BROAD PASS
At 2,300 feet, this is the lowest pass across the Alaska Range and the
entire Rocky Mountain Chain. The mountains to our 3:00NB/9:00SB are
part of the Talkeetna Mountains and the mountains to our 9:00NB/3:00SB
are part of the Alaska Range. This is a windy stretch that has snow drifts of
up to 15 feet during the winter.
The Alaska Range extends 600 miles from the Alaska Peninsula to the town
of Delta Junction, which is famous for agricultural "products" of bison and
barley. Altitudes in the Alaska Range run from 5,000 feet in the south to
20,310 feet at Denali and then back down to 8,000 feet to the east.
MP 311 SUMMIT
The large lake we can see to our 3:00NB/9:00SB side is called Summit
Lake and is positioned over the 2,363-foot summit of the continental and
watershed divide. What this means, is all of the rivers and streams that
we’ve previously passed by have been flowing south and will eventually
make their way to the cook inlet, which is the large body of water outside
of Anchorage. All the rivers and streams that we will travel by north of
here, will be flowing north and will eventually make their way to the Yukon
River, which is Alaska’s longest river extending 1,875 miles from Canada in
the east to the Bering Sea in the west. Because of its position, waters from
Summit Lake drain north and south.
About halfway through the lake you’ll see two blue and yellow signs on
either side of the train that tells us we are traveling over the highest point
on the Alaska Railroad. About halfway along the lake you’ll see a sign that
tells us we are traveling over the highest point on the Alaska Railroad.
The lakes here at Summit are abundant with lake trout, grayling and burbot,
a fresh water lingcod. Lake trout average around 6 to 8 pounds. It takes
approximately 12 to 15 years for a Lake Trout to reach 8 pounds because of
the cold-water temperature.
MP 312.5 MIRROR LAKE & LOWER EDES LAKE (Right NB, Left SB)
The long skinny lake you can see off to our 3:00NB/9:00SB side is called
lower Mirror Lake. The lake on the other side of Mirror Lake, to the east, is
Lower Edes Lake and was named after William C. Edes. Edes was the chief
engineer of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad in California before he was
appointed to the Alaska Engineering Commission in 1914, which was the
Alaska Railroad’s main builder. The small white sheds you can see on the
other side of the lake are storage sheds used by hunters and trappers in
this area.

Many people ride multiple legs or return on the train later on their trip.
Instead of saying the same narration every time you might think about
breaking your stories into parts and delivering different points on the
return trip. Variety is the spice of life.
Here are examples of stories cut to fit different amounts of time.
Sometimes you won’t have time to tell the whole story, get comfortable
summarizing or embellishing to suit your needs.
60-SECOND FAIRY TALE SAMPLE SCRIPT: 180 WORDS
To her surprise, Maria was beginning to grow attached to the wondrous
new land she had found herself in.
She missed her herd back home, of course. She also missed the sweet taste
of the bluegrass in the valley where she was raised.
But she liked walking around and leaving hoof prints in the freshly fallen
snow. She liked gazing at the tall tower that rose up from behind the castle
walls, and imagining what magnificent view it offered out onto the kingdom
grounds. But most of all, she liked her new friend.
One day, she asked the White Knight whether he might allow her to climb
the tower to see if she could spot her homeland, off in the distance.
“Well, Maria,” the Knight responded with slight hesitation. “You see, the
staircase leading up to the tower is very narrow, and I’m not sure that a
four-legged cow like yourself would be capable of making the trip up.”
“Never say never,” proclaimed Maria, as she instantly stood upright on her
hind legs and began marching toward the castle gates.
30-SECOND FAIRY TALE SAMPLE SCRIPT: 96 WORDS
As fresh snow blanketed the grounds of the kingdom, the White Knight
gazed out upon the sprawling valley, sighed to himself, and said: “I must be
the loneliest knight in all of the land.”
All of a sudden, the White Knight spotted a strange creature wandering up
the snowy path towards him. As the distance between the knight and the
creature shrank, he saw that it was a cow.
“Who goes there?” the White Knight stammered. To his surprise, a gentle
voice responded. “It is I, Maria, a calf who has found herself far from
home.”
15-SECOND FAIRY TALE SAMPLE SCRIPT: 46 WORDS
Once upon a time, in a magical kingdom surrounded by a vast valley, there
lived a young squire who dreamed of becoming a knight. Every day, the
squire carried out his daily duties, patiently awaiting the day he could
prove his worth and pass into knighthood.

BOARDING ANNOUNCEMENT
ARRIVAL ANNOUNCEMENT
WILDLIFE
Sometimes when the train slows suddenly its an indication that animals may
be on the track. We will do our best to relay this information to you as
quickly as possible, however, please remember that the loud noises from
the train sometimes startle the wildlife and they may run quickly into the
brush. The best plan is to always have your eyes peeled and cameras ready,
as you may only have seconds to take a photo!
PHOTOGRAPHY TIPS
Make sure your flash is turned off to reduce “flash back” off of the glass.
Place your camera directly against the glass to reduce or eliminate
reflection.
*We recommend putting electronics into “airplane mode”, as we do not
have Wi-Fi service onboard. Charging stations and outlets are available at
Gold Star bars (Gold Star passengers only), bistro bars, and dome cars.
(The bistro and dome cars are accessible by all passengers, especially
Adventure Class).
CLOCK POSITION/RELATIVE BEARING
This is a system of denoting impromptu relative bearing widely used in
practical navigation to give the position of an observed object readily and
comprehensibly. "Relative" means that it does not state or imply any
compass directions whatsoever. The vessel can be pointed in any direction.
The clock numbers are relative to the direction in which the train points.
The observer then measures or observes the angle made by the
intersection of the line of sight to the longitudinal axis, the dimension of
length, of the train, using the clock analogy.

FLORA
SITKA SPRUCE
Around Girdwood, surrounding the highway are Sitka Spruce trees. Sitka
Spruce, the state tree of Alaska, is a dark, heavy-limbed conifer with
branches lifting upward towards the sky rather than hanging down like the
white spruce tree. Sitka Spruce was an important wood during the early
part of WWII when light planes were constructed from the trees straightgrained
wood. Sitka Spruce also played a vital role in the building of the
Alaska Railroad as the coastal forest provided fuel, cabin logs, and
construction materials.
USNEA
“Old Man’s Beard” is a lichen that looks like light colored hairs on the trees.
Usnea can only grow in pristine environments and is used as a natural
immune booster, by the local indigenous communities.
FAUNA
BLACK BEAR
An estimated 100,000 black bears inhabit Alaska. Adults stand about 29
inches at the shoulders and are about 60 inches from nose to tail. Males
are larger than females, and weigh about 180-200 pounds in the spring.
They are considerably lighter when they emerge from winter hibernation
and may be about 20 percent heavier in the fall when they’re fat.
Black bears can vary in color from jet black to white. Black is the color
encountered most frequently across the state, but brown or cinnamoncolored
black bears are sometimes seen in Southcentral Alaska and on the
southeastern mainland. Cinnamon-colored black bears are also common in
Alaska’s Interior. Some bluish-colored bears called glacier bears may be
found in the Yakutat area and in other parts of Southeast Alaska. Black
bears often have brown muzzles and some also have a patch of white hair
on their chest.
Black bears are most easily distinguished from brown bears by their
straight facial profile and their claws, which rarely grow more than 1 ½ inches
in length. Black bears have adequate sense of sight and hearing, but have
an outstanding sense of smell.
For most of the year, black bears are solitary creatures, except from June
through July when mating takes place. The cubs are born in their dens
following a gestation period of about seven months. The cubs are born
blind and nearly hairless, weighing in under a pound. One to four cubs may
be born, but two is most common. Cubs remain with their mothers through
the first winter following birth. Black bears mature sexually at 3 to 6 years
of age, depending upon their environment. In the more southern parts of
their range, bears will breed every other year; however, if a litter is lost
early during the first summer, the sow will breed again that year. In more
marginal environments such as northern Alaska, black bears keep their
cubs with them an extra year and will breed every third year.
BROWN BEAR
Brown and grizzly bears are classified as the same species even though
there are notable differences between them. Kodiak bears (brown bears
from the Kodiak Archipelago) are classified as a distinct subspecies (U. a.
middendorffi) from those on the mainland (U. a. horribilis) because they
have been isolated from other bears since the last ice age about 12,000
years ago. “Brown bears” typically live along the southern coast of the state
where they have access to seasonally abundant spawning salmon. The
coastal areas also provide a rich array of vegetation they can use as food as
well as a milder climate. This allows them to grow larger and live in higher
densities than their “grizzly” cousins in the northern and interior parts of
57
the state. To minimize confusion, this report uses the term “brown bear” to
refer to all members of Ursus arctos.
The brown bear resembles its close relatives the black bear (U. americanus)
and the polar bear (U. maritimus). Brown bears are usually larger than black
bears, have a more prominent shoulder hump, less prominent ears, and
longer, straighter claws. Polar bears are similar in size to coastal brown
bears, but are more streamlined, lacking the hump. The varying shapes of
these bears are adaptations to their particular life styles. Long claws are
useful in digging roots or excavating small mammals, but are not efficient
for climbing trees. The musculature and bone structure of the hump are
adaptations for digging and for attaining bursts of speed necessary for
capture of moose or caribou. Color is not a reliable key in differentiating
these bears because black and brown bears have many color phases and
polar bears may have stained fur. For example, black bear fur may be black,
brown, reddish or even shades of grey and white, while brown bear colors
range from dark brown through very light blond.
Common foods include salmon, berries, grasses, sedges, cow parsnip,
ground squirrels, carrion, and roots. In many parts of Alaska, brown bears
are capable predators of moose and caribou, especially newborns. Bears
may also be attracted to human camps and homes by improperly stored
food and garbage as well as domestic animals.
WOLVES
Wolves (Canis lupus) are members of the family Canidae. Early taxonomists
recognized about 24 New World and eight Old World subspecies of Canis
lupus, with four subspecies thought to occur in Alaska. Recent studies of
skull characteristics, body size, and color suggest that differences are slight
with considerable overlap in the characteristics of wolves from various
areas. Only two Alaska subspecies are now recognized. Wolves in
Southeast Alaska tend to be darker and somewhat smaller than those in
northern parts of the state. The pelt color of Alaska wolves ranges from
black to nearly white, with every shade of gray and tan in between. Gray or
black wolves are most common, and the relative abundance of each color
phase varies over time and from place to place.
Most adult male wolves in Interior Alaska weigh from 85 to 115 pounds
(38.6-52.3), but they occasionally reach 145 pounds (65.3 kg). Females
average 10 to 15 pounds (2-5 kg) lighter than males and rarely weigh more
than 110 pounds (50 kg). Wolves reach adult size by about 1 year of age.
RAVEN
The common raven (Corvus corax) is a member of a family of birds known
as the Corvidae, which includes jays, crows, and magpies.
In Alaska, the raven can only be confused with a hawk or the much smaller
crow. Ravens have large, stout bills, shaggy throat feathers, and wedgeshaped
tails, visible best when in flight. Common ravens are large passerine
(or perching) birds that average 63 centimeters (25 inches) in length and 1.2
kilograms (2.6 pounds) in weight.
Ravens are excellent fliers, engaging in aerial acrobatics and sometimes
soaring to great heights. Flight is often an alternation of wing flapping and
gliding and is deceptively fast, as ravens move quickly with seemingly slow
wing beats. In courtship flights ravens fly with wingtips touching, and
repeatedly dive and tumble together.
There is no mistaking the raucous call of the raven; the deep, resonant
“kaw” or “prruk prruk prruk” is its trademark. However, the raven can
produce an amazing assortment of sounds: mews, whistles, high-pitched
cries, “glooks,” and dripping water sounds. One study in Alaska showed
ravens have more than 30 distinct vocalizations.
Ravens are among the most intelligent of all birds and can learn by
watching, solve problems using logic, and recognize different individuals,
human and raven. They are playful and carry sticks and feathers aloft, trade
58
them back and forth in flight and drop and retrieve them in air; they will
repeatedly slide single file down snow fields. They also interact in a playful
fashion with other animals, including wolves and bears. This likely helps
them when their scavenging puts them in close proximity to these
predators.
The raven is a year-round resident in Alaska, nesting from the Seward
Peninsula and the Brooks Range throughout the mainland, south to Kodiak
Island, throughout the Aleutian Chain and along the coast and mountains
of Southeast Alaska. The raven is found throughout most of the Northern
Hemisphere in many types of habitats, but seem to prefer forested areas
adjacent to expanses of open terrain.
Ravens often form loose flocks during the day and congregate for roosting
at night. As many as 800 ravens have been seen in one roost near
Fairbanks. When they are not breeding, they may travel 30 to 40 miles
each day from roost to daytime feeding areas.
Ravens do not undertake long migrations like many birds, but breeding
birds usually relocate for nesting each year.
BALD EAGLE
The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is named for the conspicuous
white head of the adult bird. It was named by American colonists at a time
when bald (or ‘balled’) meant white, not hairless. It takes about five years
for the distinctive white plumage of both head and tail to gradually
develop. Immature bald eagles are a mottled brown and white, and the
young birds have a black beak as opposed to the adult’s yellow beak. As
with many raptors, females are larger than males.
The bald eagle is Alaska’s largest resident bird of prey with a wing span of
up to 7.5 feet (2.3 m) and weight between 8 to 14 pounds (3.6 – 6.4 kg).
Found only in North America, bald eagles are more abundant in Alaska
than anywhere else in the United States. The Alaska population is
estimated at 30,000 birds.
These magnificent birds, recognized for their biological importance as
scavengers and predators in the natural world, are much admired for their
beauty. A national emblem of the United States since 1782, they have been
a spiritual symbol for Alaska Natives far longer than that.
Juvenile bald eagles are often confused with golden eagles (Aquila
chrysaetos). Where the two species coexist, the bald eagle is distinguished
by a lack of feathers on its lower legs and a whitish lining on the forward
part of its wings.
BEAVER
Beavers are North America’s largest rodents. They weigh on average 40 to
70 pounds, but in Alaska have been known to reach as much as 100
pounds. They reach about 3 to 4 feet in length including their tail, so
roughly about the size of a collie. They have an average life expectancy of
10 to 12 years, but have been known to live to 19 in captivity. Beavers build
ponds because it raises the water table of the environment. This creates a
safer environment for the beavers by putting more water between them
and their predators and brings a greater amount of food and building
materials closer to the water. They usually build one main dam that holds
back water about 4 to 8 feet deep. Then there is a series of smaller staging
dams; these are designed to take some of the pressure off the main dam.
The lodges and dams look like large piles and walls of sticks, rocks, grass
and mud. The lodges, which often are very old, have grass growing over the
top of them. Beaver families build their lodges in the middle of the pond
for protection while beavers living on a river will typically have lodges built
into the sides of the banks. Contrary to popular belief, beavers do not eat
fish; they actually eat the bark of cottonwood, willow and alder trees.
Beavers store their food at the bottom of the pond. In winter, when the
top of the pond freezes, the beavers release some water through the dam
59
and this creates an air pocket between the top of the liquid water and the
bottom of the ice. By doing this, they don't have to go all the way over to
their lodge to breathe. Beavers also have flaps of skin that go behind their
teeth so they can chew under water. So once again, be on the lookout for
signs of beaver!
TRUMPETER SWANS
Today we will be traveling by many ponds, so keep your eyes out for
Trumpeter Swans. They are easily identifiable as they are the largest swan
in the world; they also have extremely long white necks and large white
bodies. Trumpeter swans live to be about 13 years of age in the wild and up
to 35 years of age in captivity. It is not unusual for a pair of swans to mate
for life. Swans nest on the ground near water, usually on small islands; and
they lay 5-6 eggs. The swans that we will most likely see along the rail belt
today are Trumpeter Swans, which have all-black bills. Trumpeter Swans
are one of the largest birds in Alaska. Another interesting fact about
Trumpeter Swans is that adult swans are flightless for about a month when
they molt their feathers in the summer. As a result, male and female
trumpeters molt at different times so one adult in a breeding pair will be
able to fly while the other stays with the young swans. A male swan is called
a Cob. The female is called a Pen and the young of the year are called
cygnets (pronounced 'sig-nets')
DALL SHEEP
Named for William H. Dall, one of the first men to survey the lower Yukon
in 1866, Dall sheep are sometimes referred to as Alaska bighorn sheep
because the Rocky Mountain bighorn are a closely related species. Rams,
noticeable by their bright white color, grow large cured horns formed from
a specialized skin structure made up of a compacted mass of hair and oil.
The horns are not shed each fall but instead the sheep add another ring to
their horns yearly so the longer the horns, the older the ram, and thus the
more dominant that ram is within the herd. It is quite common for people
to confuse Dall sheep with Mountain Goats; however, they have some very
distinct differences. The Dall Sheep have horns that can reach a full curl or
more and the thick white hair on the animal is very coarse and short; the
Mountain Goat has short, almost spiked horns, and their hair is quite long.
Mountain Goats also prefer higher elevations than Dall sheep.
The rams (males) weigh about 300 lbs., while the ewes (females) weigh
about 150 lbs. The Dall sheep make their home in the high alpine tundra
and subsist on grasses, mosses, lichens, and flowers. Dall sheep have
excellent sight and their climbing ability keeps their enemies at a far
distance. Roughly 60,000 to 80,000 Dall sheep reside in the Chugach,
Kenai, Alaska and Wrangell mountain ranges in Alaska. During the summer,
the rams migrate high into the ranges, leaving the prime lower grazing
grounds for the ewes and lambs.
Dall Sheep are the only wild sheep in the world. Dall Sheep are herbivores
and they have two-toed hooves, which enables them to move well on
rough, uneven ground. During the summer when food is abundant, the
sheep eat a wide variety of plants. The winter diet is much more limited,
and consists primarily of dry, frozen grass and sedge stems available when
snow is blown off, lichen, and moss.
ARCTIC TERN
Nests are sometimes seen between train tracks. The arctic tern is a
medium sized bird growing to an average height of about a foot tall with
around a 2 ft. wing span. They are grey and white with black capped heads,
and their beaks and feet are bright orange. Their diet consists of mostly
small fish, crustaceans, and insects. The terns’ travel from arctic breeding
grounds to its wintering grounds off of Antarctica covers 24,000 miles! This
is the farthest yearly journey of any bird.

BELUGA WHALES
Due to the density of silt in the Turnagain Arm, no sunlight penetrates
through the water. Without sunlight, the process of photosynthesis cannot
occur and without photosynthesis, no animal life, not even plankton can
exist in the Arm. Thus, the Turnagain Arm is literally lifeless, yet the streams
that feed the Arm contain salmon.
To get to their spawning beds, the salmon must swim from the ocean
through the Turnagain Arm up to their spawning streams. Following the
salmon into the Arm each year are the beluga whales. Beluga whales, which
in Russian means “white”, are a small toothed whale that looks much like an
oversized dolphin. An adult male can weigh 2,000 pounds and reach 15 feet
in length. Their life expectancy reaches about 40 years.
In the water to our 9:00 side, be on the lookout for Beluga whales. Belugas
are white whales 11-16 feet long, weighing about 2,000 lbs. when full grown
and live up to 40 years.
In fact, the common name “beluga” was originally derived from the Russian
word for white, which is, “belukha”. When we see the Beluga whales, they
don’t breach, or jump out of the water. They just roll up out of the water to
take a breath of air, so we only see their backs. The beluga whale has
developed many adaptations that differ from other whales to better suit
the environment they live in. They are not as sleek as their cousins the
dolphin, due to the presence of a blubber layer that can be as much as 5
inches thick. Also a small beak characterizes their head and a bulging
“melon” shaped head that is quite agile compared to other whales. In fact
the Beluga whale is the only whale that can bend its neck. These features
are probably an advantage when maneuvering and catching prey in muddy
or ice covered water. Belugas have been known to live up to 60 years! Bald
Eagles are also prevalent along Turnagain Arm, especially during low tide.
Be sure to shout out if you see whales or other wildlife.
MOOSE
As we travel along the river banks and open landscape through this area,
be on the lookout for moose. Moose are herbivores that eat leaves and
twigs of willow, birch, and aspen trees, along with pond weeds, and grasses.
They are the largest member of the deer family. The Alaska-Yukon moose is
the largest moose in the world! Adult moose can range in size from a small
800 pound adult female, to a large 1,600 pound adult male. They can reach
heights up to almost 6 feet tall. Bull moose are often easily recognized by
their antlers, which are carried only by the males. Adult males engage in
the “rut” in late September and early October. Females, or “cows”, give
birth to calves in the spring. Calves are weaned in the fall at the time the
mother starts breeding again, and they usually get chased off just before
she gives birth again in the spring.
OSPREY
Osprey are identified as raptors, with a wingspan of 5 1/2 ft. weighing in at 3
lbs. as adults. Male and female birds both assist in building their nests,
which have an average size of 3-6 ft. in diameter. Osprey nests can be seen
on trees, posts, towers, rock points, telephone poles, and old telegraph
poles. We see several osprey nests along the rail belt, and since they
mostly hunt for fish, we commonly see them in the marshy wetlands.
Osprey migrate to Mexico and Central and South America during the
winter. In mid-May, females lay 2-4 eggs. Both adults will take turns
incubating the eggs until they hatch after 5-6 weeks. In mid-August,
nestlings begin flapping exercises. Keep a look out for osprey flying nearby,
or perched in the nests on top of towers and telephone poles, in these
areas.
61
SMELT
Smelt are a common sight during May in the creeks along the highway.
When crossing Twenty-Mile Creek, look for people throwing nets into the
water. Hooligan, also known as candlefish, is one of five species of the smelt
family found in Alaska. Candlefish are caught, dried and because they are
so oily they can be fitted with a wick and burned exactly like a candle.
SPRUCE BARK BEETLE (Anywhere)
The forest in the Moose Pass/Trail Lake area consists primarily of mature
spruce and hemlock with pockets of birch.
The spruce trees in this region are being attacked by a tiny beetle known
as the spruce bark beetle. Infested trees take on an orange to reddish hue
about one year after beetles enter the soft inner bark layer to lay their
eggs. In turn, the damage to the trees is not caused by the adult beetle but
rather the larvae.
Larval feeding eventually destroys this layer of bark that transports tree
nutrients from the roots to the outer part of the tree. Spruce beetle
outbreaks stunts the growth of trees and can cause tree mortality.
While the spruce beetle is a natural part of the forest ecosystem, a massive
spruce beetle outbreak has killed mature spruce trees on one million acres
of the Kenai Peninsula since the mid-70’s. That equals about 50% of the
peninsula’s forested land. Climate change in the region (hotter/drier
conditions) is cited as the reason for the beetle outbreak.
You might have noticed that many trees in this area look dead or dying.
That is because they have become infested with the Spruce Bark Beetle.
These beetles are present in small numbers in all spruce forests, but over
the last decade their population has increased dramatically and caused a
major infestation problem in South-Central Alaska. The beetles burrow
into and lay their eggs in under the bark of the tree, disrupting the flow of
nutrients throughout the tree. This eventually kills the tree. After
remaining in the infested tree for two years, the new beetles will emerge
after three consecutive days where the temperature reaches 61 degrees
Fahrenheit, and find another spruce tree to infest. Many solutions have
been proposed, including controlled burns of ‘beetle-kill’ areas as well as
using a spray designed to defend spruce trees from the beetles. This spray
is used in and around the city of Anchorage in an attempt to prevent the
beetles from penetrating city limits and creating these extreme fire
hazards. It seems there is no quick fix for the Spruce Bark Beetle
infestation, but hopefully, we’ll have the situation under control in the next
few years.

PREHISTORIC FAUNA
During the Late Precambrian, Alaska was covered by a shallow sea. This sea
was home to bacteria and stromatolites that would later fossilize. Most of
the state continued to be submerged by the sea. By this time Alaska was
home to brachiopods and trilobites. During the ensuing Ordovician and
Silurian a chain of volcanic islands occupied what is now the eastern part of
the state. These islands originated as a result of contemporary local
tectonism. Coral reefs formed in the seas around these islands. The
northern third of Alaska was still covered by seawater from the Devonian
to the Permian. Local marine life included ammonites, brachiopods, corals,
and gastropods. At least 34 different species of gastropods lived in Alaska
during the late Paleozoic. Of these, 9 were completely new to science
when first discovered.
During the Triassic, the sea expanded. Northern Alaska was submerged
under deep water. Southern Alaska was under a shallow sea. The state's
Triassic sea was home to bony fish, ichthyosaurs, and mollusca. Volcanic
episodes happened frequently in the state at this time. Volcanism
continued into the Jurassic as Alaska experienced a period of relative
geologic upheaval. Areas of the state remained inundated by the sea. This
sea was home to ammonites and crinoids. In the middle Jurassic most of
the mountain ranges characterizing modern Alaska began to form. Alaska's
Middle Jurassic Callovian deposits are part of a large geologic region
spreading down through Canada and even into the Lower 48 states
including Montana, Idaho, North Dakota, Utah and New Mexico. From the
mid to late Jurassic, the area now occupied by Snug Harbor was home to a
great diversity of marine invertebrates, which left behind a plethora of
fossils. Among these were ammonites. Others include belemnites, the
gastropod Amberlya, the pelecypods Lima, Oxytoma, and possibly Astarte
and Isocyprina.
Cretaceous Alaska gained additional landmass due to collisions with other
tectonic plates. Local mountain building resulted in the formation of the
Brooks Range and other topographic features. Some areas of Alaska were
covered by the sea and others were dry land. There were at least 5 species
of Inoceramus in Alaska during the Cretaceous period. This was a
widespread genus in Alaska and its fossil remains have been discovered in
hundreds of different places. Other Cretaceous shellfish were preserved at
what is now Umiat Mountain. More than 235 species of plants are known to
have grown in Alaska during the Cretaceous, most of which were cycads.
Their remains are scattered across hundreds of sites. Among the finds
were algae, Ampelopsis, conifers, elm, Ficus, a great diversity of hepaticae,
laurel, magnolia, oaks, Pinus, Platanus, and sequoias. Invertebrate remains
were also found with the plants. Pieces of Cretaceous amber have been
found on the shore of Nelson Island, which is located in the Bering Sea.
Dinosaurs lived in Alaska during the Cretaceous.
Alaska remained tectonically active into the Cenozoic era. Volcanism
produced the Aleutian Islands. During the Eocene, Alaska's plants
resembled those today growing in the temperate, subtropical and tropical
regions of earth today. Their remains were preserved in locations such as
the Alaska Peninsula, Awik, the Cook Inlet's shoreline, Eagle City, Unga
Island. Alaska's late Miocene fossil record also documents the state's
ancient invertebrates. From the Miocene to the Pliocene, Alaska's land area
just about reached its full modern extent. Alaska's late Pliocene fossils
record also documents the state's invertebrates of that age. During periods
of low sea level a land bridge connected Alaska and Asia, allowing an
exchanged of the continents' wildlife. Significant areas of Alaska were
covered by glaciers during the Quaternary. Alaska was also the site of
63
continued volcanic activity. In Alaska, Pleistocene mammal remains are
often associated with artifacts left by Folsom people. Geologically recent
invertebrate fossils are also known from Alaska.
The Quugaarpaq is a tusked monster from Yup'ik folklore reported to
burrow underground. Fresh air was said to be deadly for the Quugaarpaq,
mere contact with which would cause it to petrify. These stories are based
on fossils of Ice Age proboscideans whose buried remains are sometimes
discovered eroding out of the sediment during spring in southeastern
Alaska. Many other indigenous cultures from around the world have
interpreted proboscidean fossils as the remains of colossal burrowing
animals.
During the early Cenozoic, Alaska had a subtropical environment. The local
seas continued to drop until a land bridge connected the state with Asia.
Early humans crossed this bridge and remains of contemporary local
wildlife such as woolly mammoths often show signs of having been
butchered.
The story of the discovery of dinosaurs in Alaska began by accident in 1961.
A geologist exploring along the Colville River on Alaska’s North Slope
discovered what he assumed were bone samples from Ice Age animals,
probably no more than two million years old, and didn't try to identify them
further. Then in 1978, another geologist found dinosaur footprints near
Black Lake on the Alaska Peninsula. These footprints and other imprints
found elsewhere in Alaska in the 1970s revolutionized the thinking about
the possibility that dinosaurs had at one time lived in Alaska. In 1984, a
USGS geologist reexamined the 1961 fossils and identified them as the first
dinosaur bones found in Alaska. To date, at least 12 different types of
dinosaurs have been discovered on the North Slope. In 1994, a 90 million
year old hadrosaur was discovered in the central Talkeetna Mountains. It is
the oldest hadrosaur known in Alaska and one of the oldest in North
America.
The first evidence of dinosaurs in Denali National Park was discovered near
Igloo Creek about 35 miles west of the park entrance on June 27, 2005.
The fossil, a three-toed dinosaur track, is roughly 70 million years old. It was
found during a geology field camp in the park. On this particular day an
Associate Professor of Geology casually rested his hand on an outcrop of
the Cantwell Formation not far from the Denali Park Road at Igloo Creek as
he explained to his students that this type of Cretaceous sedimentary rock
commonly preserves dinosaur tracks and that they should be alert for
them. To his surprise, a student immediately spied the dinosaur track not
far from his gesturing hand and asked, “Like that one?” This first dinosaur
fossil found is a cast, i.e., a bump on the rock, not an indentation. It was
made when a dinosaur left its three-toed footprint in mud. Over time this
depression filled with sediments that solidified into rock. The mudstone
weathered away and left the cast exposed. This fossil track was made by a
theropod, a meat-eating dinosaur with small front “arms” that walked on its
hind legs. The track cast is about 9 inches (~23 cm) from toe to heel and 6
inches (15 cm) wide and is estimated to have been made by a modest sized
theropod, around 10 feet (3 meters) long that might have weighed 100-200
lbs (45-90 kg). The fossil is now displayed in the Murie Science and
Learning Center near the park's entrance.
Since the discovery of this first dinosaur track fossil in 2005, hundreds of
sites with thousands of other fossils have been found in Denali, with new
fossils finds every year. These fossils include additional species of
dinosaurs tracks and coprolites (feces), as well as traces of flying reptiles,
birds, clams, worms, and other invertebrates. A more complete ecological
64
picture about life in Denali about 70 million years ago is emerging from the
first fossil find and all the ones that have followed.
The eroding bluffs of the North Slope has yielded many dinosaur fossils
over the last couple of decades. But the baby dino bones that were found
in sediments collected by University of Alaska Fairbanks and Florida State
University scientists indicate year-round residency. Dinosaurs likely had
incubation periods upwards of five to six months for some species. And if
that’s the case, a dinosaur laying its eggs in the spring would have been
hatching them late in the summer, if dinosaurs were migrating, they would
have had very little time to move to lower latitudes with newborns, which
suggests that the animals did not, in fact migrate.
Horned Pachyrhinosaurus
The Pachyrhinosaurus, a large, sturdy herbivore with prominent curved
horns on its frill and skull, was discovered by Charles M. Sternberg in 1946.
These dinosaurs grew up to 26 feet long and weighed about four tons.
Pachyrhinosaurus roamed together as packs across a surprisingly large
range in Alaska and Alberta about 73.5 to 72.5 million years ago.
Paleontologists excavated the Alaska dinosaur, Pachyrhinosaurus known as
P. perotorum named after Texan billionaire Ross Perot. This horned
dinosaur gained recent popularity in the 2013 movie, Walking with
Dinosaurs: The Movie, and it was also the official mascot of the 2010 Arctic
Winter Games.
Tyrannosauridae
Gorgosaurus, the “fierce lizard,” is a member of the Tyrannosauridae family,
which is famously captained by the Tyrannosaurus Rex. However, unlike the
famed T-Rex or its close relative the Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus is smaller,
slimmer and has longer legs, allowing it to outrun much of the competition
— fellow predators and prey alike. Gorgosaurus is an apex predator who
roamed Alaska’s North Slope, Montana and Canada around 76.6 to 75.1
million years ago. The carnivore, first described by Lawrence Lambe in 1914,
grew to about 30 feet in length and weighed around 2.8 tons. Gorgosaurus
is among the more studied dinosaurs because it is the best-represented
tyrannosaurid in the fossil record, allowing paleontologists to investigate its
life history and ontogeny.
Nanuqsaurus (meaning "polar bear lizard") is a genus of carnivorous
tyrannosaurid theropod known from the Late Cretaceous period (early
Late Maastrichtian stage) Prince Creek Formation of the North Slope of
Alaska, United States. It contains a single species, Nanuqsaurus hoglundi,
known only from a partial skull. Fiorillo and Tykoski stated that this lack of
food might explain Nanuqsaurus's unusually small size for an advanced
tyrannosaur, as a large animal cannot survive on scarce resources.
Nanuqsaurus may have evolved a smaller size because of the decrease in
year-round food supply, caused by the colder temperatures. However, later
studies suggested that its supposed small size was unfounded, and that it
was likely similar in size to other North American tyrannosaurids such as
Albertosaurus.
Edmontosaurus – Hadrosaur
The Edmontosaurus is an herbivore with up to 2,000 teeth, six rows deep,
that roamed north of the Arctic Circle through Alberta and parts of Alaska.
Edmontosaurus lived 76 to 64 million years ago and was one of the last nonavian
dinosaurs to explore the Earth. This Alaska dinosaur was relatively
small compared to its peers, roughly the size of a modern elephant. It
65
moved on two or four legs, weighed up to four tons and grew to 43 feet in
length. Edmontosaurus was named in 1917 by Lawrence Lambe, despite
Othniel Charles Marsh discovering the species in 1892. Unlike many of its
herbivorous peers, Edmontosaurus didn’t have any armor or natural
weapons, so the species likely moved around in large herds for protection.
Ugrunaaluk (oo-GREW-na-luck) kuukpikensis (KOOK-pik-en-sis)
Researchers at the University of Alaska Museum of the North have
described a new species of hadrosaur, a type of duck-billed dinosaur that
once roamed the North Slope of Alaska in herds. Now on display in the
museum lobby, an original painting by Anchorage artist James Havens
depicting Alaska's newest dinosaur species, along with skeletal mounts of
three juvenilesmade from casts of the fossils used to describe the new
species.
Troodon – Maniraptoran
Troodon is theorized to be the smartest dinosaur and among the smartest
creatures in the Campanian age of the Cretaceous period, although it’s
intellectual capabilities are estimated to be lower than a house cat. This
small, bird-like omnivore thrived 76 million years ago and was named by
Joseph Leidy in 1856. The swift-moving dinosaur stood about 11 feet tall and
weighed roughly 110 pounds. The normal length of Troodon was 50% larger
in Alaska compared to more southerly areas, possibly because a larger eye
size allowed it to hunt more effectively in low-light conditions.

PLACES OF INTEREST
Alaska SeaLife Center
The Sea Life Center is a cold water marine science facility and it’s mission
is to combine research with wildlife rehabilitation and public education. It
opened in 1998 with money from grants, bonds, donations, and fines from
the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
They take in orphan animals and stabilize them to be released back into the
wild or transferred to a new home. Over the past year their “patients” have
included: Sea Otters, Harbor Seals, Stellar Sea Lions and over a dozen
birds.
Research is currently being done to learn more about the local marine
birds and wildlife. The main research going on right now is to find out why
the Stellar Sea Lions and the Sea Otters population in the Gulf of Alaska
region are declining so quickly.

NATURE
DENALI
The highest peak in North America, the mountain is actually so high that it
creates its own weather. Because of this, it is only around 33% completely
visible on a crystal clear summer day, with about a 40% chance of it being
partially hidden by its own cloud system, and a 25% chance of not being
seen at all! So we are extremely lucky to get such a great view today! In
about fifteen minutes we will be coming up to an even better viewpoint
and slowing down for photos, so keep those cameras out.
(Denali’s official height above sea level was officially recalibrated from its
original measurement of 20,320 ft. (1953), to 20,237 ft. in 2013 using a
remote-sensing technique (InSAR), and finally using GPS survey data for its
final measure in September of 2015 at 20,310 ft.
On Sunday, August 30th 2015, Interior of Alaska Secretary Sally Jewell
signed a secretarial order with the approval of President Barack Obama
before he visited Alaska to officially re-name the tallest peak in North
America from Mt. McKinley (named after Ohio senator William H. McKinley
in 1896 who was for the gold standard) to its original native Athabaskan
name, “Denali”)
Of the 20 tallest mountains on the Continent, 17 are in Alaska. The North
and South Peaks and South Buttress of Denali, Mt. Foraker and Mt. Hunter
are all among these 20 tallest mountains and are all located right here in
Denali National Park. We have 19 peaks in Alaska that reach over 14,000
feet. Denali is surrounded by several other mountains and when the
weather is cloudy, it is easy to think that one of the smaller ones is actually
Denali. However, on a clear day, it is easy to see that Denali towers high
above over the others:
South Peak of Denali 20,312’
North Peak of Denali 19,469’
Mt. Russell 11,670'
Mt. Foraker 17,400'
Mt. Hunter 14,570'

AVALANCHES
A very common hazard in Alaska is the vast number of avalanches that
occur in the winter. The nine-mile section of the Alaska Railroad and the
Seward Highway between Girdwood and Bird Point is known as one of the
68
most avalanche-prone transportation corridors in the world. The Seward
Highway is a lifeline for the communities of Girdwood, Kenai, Homer and
Seward. With an average of 5,000 vehicles traveling this stretch of road
every day in the winter, it is very important to keep this road open as much
as possible. Thus, to prevent unexpected avalanches from stranding
motorists, and perhaps causing injuries or fatalities, the State Department
of Transportation will close the road temporarily in the winter to "shoot
down" potential avalanche chutes. They use a 105mm Howitzer cannon
which was purchased by the Alaska Railroad from the Army to send up an
artillery shell to dislodge the snow, making it easier to “control” the
sometimes unpredictable avalanches.
Also, this section of track we are traveling on is a recent addition. The
Alaska Railroad Corporation and the Department of Transportation
completed a large project here in 2004. The rail was originally right along
the side of the mountains, and the shore was much closer to the mountains
as well. But by placing thousands of cubic feet of rock into the inlet the
shoreline was extended over 100 feet! Then the railroad tracks and road
were moved to their present location. All of this was done to place the
train and cars as far away from the avalanches as possible. And if you look
to the 3:00 side you see that small raised bike path, it acts as a type of
retention wall for snow coming down during avalanches. During winter
operations passenger trains are not allowed to travel south of Portage due
to avalanche conditions.
PERMAFROST
As we travel through this area you will see many swampy, bog-like areas.
These areas are known as muskeg and are created by permafrost.
Permafrost is ground that is frozen for at least 2 consecutive years.
Permafrost usually lays 4-6 feet beneath the surface and can be 2,000 feet
thick. Approximately 85% of Alaska contains permafrost. The frozen layer
of permafrost stops water from seeping far into the ground and creates the
swampy muskeg. Another sign of permafrost is the patches of black spruce
trees. Black spruce trees often grow on permafrost-affected areas where
other trees cannot, because their root systems extend outward instead of
down where the ground is too solid to penetrate. The permafrost does
stunt their growth so some of the small trees you are seeing are over 30
years old.
GEOLOGY
As we pass through this area you can see a definite lack of mountains and
rock outcroppings, with the exception of the Talkeetna Mountains. This
area is a large outwash basin for old glaciers that originated in the
Talkeetna Mountains and the Alaska Range. All of the lakes, as well as the
marsh grasslands, are another example of how the geological processes
shaped this great land.
Glaciers at one time covered all of this area and as they retreated
approximately 9,000 years ago they left large blocks of ice that would
eventually melt and leave depressions that then filled with water. Some of
the grasslands and forested areas were formed when glaciers left higher
areas of sediment called drumlins. These did not collect water, and
vegetation developed. As the early vegetation grew, eventually it
decomposed and formed soils for the larger trees that you see today. The
way some of these grasslands developed was through a process known as
“eutrophication”. This is when dust and dirt accumulate in a lake and the
slow encroachment of vegetation shrinks the lake until nothing is left
except the marsh grasslands. Some of this land that still has a substantial
amount of moisture in it freezes and becomes permafrost. I will be telling
you a little bit more about permafrost in a short while. Eventually, in some
of the areas, the vegetation dies and becomes thick enough to support
69
heavier root systems and larger vegetation develops. You can see on some
of the edges of these marshes where the black spruce trees are slowly
making attempts to fill in the land.
Tides:
· Incoming tides called flood tide. The highest maximum tides are called
spring ties.
· Outflowing tides called ebb tides. The lowest minimum tides are called
neap tides.
· Slack tide – water flow ceases.
· Time between tides is approx. 12 hours 25.2 minutes which is ½ of a tidal
lunar day.
Bore Tide – The bore tide is a rush of seawater that returns to a shallow
and narrowing inlet from a broad bay. The wave must overcome other
frictional forces as well such as the outgoing tide, topography of the ocean
floors (bathymetery) and the wind. Bore tides occur all over the world –
approx. 60 – but only a few are large enough to make a name for
themselves. Example- Tsientang China the wave height can reach 30 ft. and
travel at 20 mph.
What is so great about Turnagain Arm Bore Tide? It’s one of the largest in
the world and occurs with great regularity. It’s the only one that occurs in
the far North and the only one bordered by mountains, making it the most
unique and geologically dramatic bore tide in the world. It’s also amazingly
accessible. Nature’s tidal wave.
Viewing- get a tide table and follow the instructions. Best time is around
the new and full moons. Extreme low tides promise the largest bores.
In winter Turnagain Arm looks completely different. It’s littered with chunks
of discolored ice burgs and snow. Many of the bergs are larger than the
largest vehicles. Because of the radical tide changes the ice is picked up
and moved around twice daily scouring everything on the ocean floor.
Another phenomena of the Turnagain Arm are the bore tides that roll
through the arm periodically. While the Turnagain Arm has the second
highest tide in North America, the arm also has the opposite extreme lows.
These diurnal tides, two high tides and two low tides in a 24-hour period,
keep the Turnagain Arm in constant motion.
A tidal bore is a high, abrupt tidal wave that occurs in a narrow, tapering
channel where tidal changes are extreme. Because Turnagain Arm is
relatively shallow and is a constricted arm of the sea adjacent to a deeper
body of water with a large range in tides, these bore tides occur. Bore tides,
known to occur in only 67 places around the world,reach amazing heights
and remarkable velocity. Bore tides towering as high as 26 feet and
traveling up to 24 miles per hour have been recorded in different parts of
the world.
Turnagain Arm is one of the few locations where a bore tide occurs
regularly in the U.S. The statistics for bore tides in the Turnagain Arm are:
Range in size from 1⁄2 foot to 6 feet high
Travel up to 15 miles per hour
Occur daily, usually 1 3⁄4 to 2 1⁄2 hours after the predicted low tide in
Anchorage. Opposing wind can increase visibility of bore tides.
As you travel north from Seward, located to the north are the Chugach
Mountains which are part of Chugach State Park. On the cliffs of the park,
rock climbers are often spotted in the summer as well as hikers and
mountain bikers. Located to the south are the Kenai Mountains which
range in height from 2,000 feet to 6,000 feet.
On a clear day, the Alaska Range is visible to the west. The Alaska Range,
which includes Mt. McKinley, forms an arc that spreads across the middle
70
of the state. Some of the more visible mountains in the Alaska Range are
the volcanoes Mt. Redoubt and Mt. Spurr, seen across Cook Inlet. Also, Mt.
Foraker and Mt. Hunter which can be seen to the left of Mt. McKinley.
While this chain of mountains is volcanically active, only in recent years has
the south central region experienced any eruptions. Some geologists
consider Mt. Spurr to be the northern terminus of the Aleutian Range,
which is volcanic. That is how geologists differentiate between the
Aleutians and the Alaska Range, which is not volcanic.
In December of 1989, Mt. Redoubt erupted and sent an ash plume over
40,000 feet into the air. Again in 1992, Redoubt erupted and laid a blanket
of ash over the Anchorage area and caused major delays both on the
ground and in the air. (See more information on volcanoes in the
Miscellaneous Information section of this commentary.)
Aurora and CME’s - Coronal mass ejection is a massive burst of solar wind
being released into space. The largest of the magnetic storms create the
most intense Auroras.
Weather extremes – in Alaska temperatures extremes vary from 100 Deg. F
(record) above and to -80Deg.F (record) below. Thermometers at the time
were only calibrated to 80 below. How cold did it really get?
Chinook winds – can raise temps from 40 below to 40 above in just a few
hours. When the wind stops temperatures plummet dramatically.
Length of Day light – Fairbanks gets 3 hours and 43 minutes of twilight on
winter solstice and 21 hours 49 minutes on summer solstice.
GLACIALY-FED RIVERS
Looking at the Susitna River, you have probably noticed that the water
looks "dirty" or “murky”, this is due to the abundance of glacial silt in the
water. Glaciers have been called ‘nature’s bulldozers’ because as they
move down mountains, they carve out U-shaped valleys and also pick up
rocks and debris. Over centuries of ice buildup and movement, the debris
becomes pulverized into fine sediment. As the glacier melts this sediment
is suspended in the water and is what gives the water its murky, or dirty,
color. A glacier is formed when annual snow accumulation at the top of the
mountain or glacier is greater than the annual summer melt at the bottom
or terminus of the glacier. This causes the snow to compress itself forming
dense, very heavy ice that moves downward, aided by the forces of gravity.
Because of the great density of this ice, it absorbs all colors of light except
short wavelength blue light. As the ice melts the dense crystal structure
breaks down and reflects all the colors so it looks white. That is why you
will sometimes see the deepest blue in the new cracks and crevasses; the
ice has not had time to break down and is still very dense. The colors
sometimes appear the richest on cloudy days because the direct sunlight
makes the wet ice produce a glare making it hard to see the true colors.
Another interesting thing about glaciers that is commonly overlooked is
that a glacier exists for a much greater amount of time than any of the ice
within it. Remember, new ice is constantly forming in the zone of
accumulation, flowing downward and melting. So ice can cycle through a
glacier, while the glacier just gets older. The ice in a typical Alaskan glacier
is less than 100 years old, although glaciers have been in Alaska since the
last Ice Age (more than 10,000 years ago).
Glacial Silt
The sand-like material surrounding the Turnagain Arm is glacial silt or rock
flour. Although the silt beaches surrounding the Turnagain Arm look
enticing on warm days, the silt is extremely dangerous. When mixed with
the right amount of water, the silt acts like quicksand and has the potential
71
to trap whatever happens to walk on it. Advisories are posted along the
Arm warning people of the dangers of silt.
Quick Mountain Facts:
Average elevation in the Alaska Range: 7,500 feet.
3 highest peaks in the Alaska Range: McKinley (20,320), Foraker (17,400)
and Hunter (14,573).
Aleutian Range is the SW continuation of the Alaska Range.
Average elevation in the Aleutian Range: 5,000 feet.
4 higheast peaks in the Aleutian Range: Spurr - closest to Anchorage
(11,066), Redoubt – across from Kenai (10,197), Iliamna – NW of Homer
(10,016) and Augustine – SW of Homer (4,206), all of which are volcanic and
have erupted since the 1950s.
TIDES
The body of water to our 9:00 side is Turnagain Arm, which flows into Cook
Inlet, all of which is part of the Pacific Ocean. The water we see is salt
water mixed with fresh water creeks and glacially fed rivers, and we are
approximately at sea level. Turnagain Arm, along with Knik Arm, have
North America's second greatest tide change, reaching almost 40 feet
(38.9').
(FYI – the highest tides in North America are in the Bay of Fundy, in
Canada, between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick with a maximum tide
change of 56 ft.)
Here you can see a vast area of mud flats (if the tide is out). Mud flats are
created by deposits of glacial silt from the many glacially fed rivers in the
area. As glaciers are formed, rocks, vegetation and other debris become
buried in the snow. With the progression of time and the movement of the
glacier, these rocks and other items become pulverized into very fine
sediment. As the face of the glacier melts, this sediment is carried in the
melt-off water and gives many of Alaska’s rivers and streams their dirty or
murky color. Eventually the melt-off water makes its way to the ocean, and
much of the sediment settles, creating mudflats.
These mud flats can be dangerous for unsuspecting explorers who venture
out on the flats at low tide. Even though the mud can seem as solid as
concrete when the tide is out, it only takes a short period of time for this
mud to become like quicksand as the tide comes in. This is one of the few
places in the world where you can see a "bore tide". Because of the great
tidal changes, the outgoing tide will meet the incoming tide and the two
forces fight each other, creating a "wall of water" until the incoming tide
eventually overcomes the outgoing tide. These tides have been known to
reach over six feet high and move at the rate of about 10 knots. This spot
has also become a favorite spot for wind surfers as it offers some of the
best windsurfing conditions. Windsurfing in Alaska is rather expensive and
requires a good "dry suit", since the water is just slightly above freezing. A
dry suit is designed to completely keep the moisture off the body. This
area is only for experienced wind surfers since the tides coupled with the
dangers of the mud flats can be quite dangerous, even though the water is
only about 3 feet deep in places. During the summer, it is not unlikely to
see windsurfers from the tracks!
GLACIER INFORMATION
Over 100,000 glaciers cover about 29,000 square miles of Alaska or 5% of
the land area; which is 128 times more glacial coverage than the rest of the
United States. Glaciers have been a dominant factor in carving out Alaska's
terrain for millions of years. Ice close to 1/2 a mile deep during the
Pleistocene age almost carved a fjord all the way to Cook Inlet, had this ice
completed its journey, the Kenai Peninsula would now be an island. Many
examples of glaciation can be seen on exposed rock. They are ground
smooth and rounded by the ice flow.
72
A glacier is formed when annual snow accumulation at the top of the
mountain is greater than the amount melted. Over time as more and more
snow is not melted during the summer it collects and this causes the snow
to compress forming dense, very heavy ice that moves downward aided by
the forces of gravity. Because of the great density of this ice it absorbs all
colors of light except the blue wave length. Different colors of light have
different amounts of energy and only the blue light that has some of the
greatest amount of energy can escape the density of the ice. As the ice
melts the dense crystal structure breaks down and reflects all the colors so
it looks white. That is why you will sometimes see the deepest blue in the
new cracks and crevasses; the ice has not had time to break down and is
still very dense.
The colors sometimes appear the richest on cloudy days. One reason is
because the direct sunlight makes the wet ice give off a glare making it hard
to see the true colors. Many glaciers will look gray or dirty simply due to
the amount of rocks and debris which become embedded into the ice,
while some will appear white because they have a higher amount of air
bubbles trapped in the ice.
Most of Alaska's glaciers are currently receding. You can't actually see a
glacier move, but there are clues to the movement. Large chunks of ice
may break off from the face of the glacier; this is referred to as calving. If
you are going on a cruise through Resurrection Bay in Seward, you may
have the opportunity to see a tidewater glacier calve. It is quite a
spectacular sight to see a glacier calve into a large body of water. If you
stand near a glacier for any length of time you can hear the movement in
sounds such as groaning or creaking. Sometimes this noise can get quite
loud.
Glaciers can move at varying speeds, some as fast as a foot or more a day,
others as slow as only a few inches a year. Three things usually determine
the speed at which a glacier moves: the thickness of the ice, the angle of
the terrain it is on and the climate of the area. Skookum Glacier is an
example of a recently melted glacial valley and outwash. Skookum means
really good, right on, and excellent or it can mean tough and durable. So if
you’re Skookum, you’re trustworthy, honest, reliable and hardworking.
The three types of glaciers we will see today are hanging glaciers, piedmont
glaciers, and tidewater glaciers for those of you taking a boat tour. Hanging
glaciers originate at the peaks of the mountains and are attached to the
slopes, but do not extend into the valley bottoms. Piedmont glaciers
originate at the peaks and flow into the valley bottoms. Tidewater glaciers
are similar to piedmont glaciers however their faces terminate in the ocean.

ADDITIONAL NARRATION
IDITAROD STORY (Willow, Nenana)
The Iditarod Race, as we know it today, was started in 1973 by Dorothy Page
and Joe Reddington, Sr. they wanted a way to commemorate the mushers
of the original dash to Nome in 1925.
In the winter of 1925, the town of Nome, located on Alaska's northwest
coast, was hit with an outbreak of diphtheria, which could have turned into
a serious epidemic. In Nome, they did not have enough serum for the
number of people who had contracted the disease. An urgent appeal was
sent out for diphtheria serum. The only serum in Alaska was found in
Anchorage at the Alaska Railroad Hospital. The problem was getting it to
Nome in the shortest time possible.
Typically it took 25 days to get from Anchorage to Nome at that time of
year because ships could not get through the frozen Bering Sea and the
airplanes of 1925 were not yet equipped to fly in the severe winter weather
conditions. Mushing the serum all the way to Nome was considered, but it
was determined that the fastest way to get the serum to Nome was to
transport it from Anchorage to Nenana by way of the Alaska Railroad, then
by a sled dog team across the remaining 670 miles to Nome.
The Alaska Railroad promptly loaded the serum onto a train and sent it up
to Nenana. From there, 20 dog teams defied the elements, traveling day
and night at record speeds, relaying it to Nome in less than a week! With
the help of the Alaska Railroad, the brave mushers and dog teams, the
town of Nome was saved.
The Iditarod Race starts on the first Saturday in March of each year and
can be seen on national television. There is a ceremonial start in
Anchorage, then sled dogs are loaded into trucks and driven to Willow for
the official start the following day.

ALASKA NELLIE (Grandview, Lawing, Curry)
A story of Alaska and the Alaskan Railroad would not be complete without
the legend of Alaska Nellie. In 1916, Nellie Trosper became the first woman
to get a roadhouse contract from the Railroad. She named her spot
“Grandview.” Nellie became known for her strength and endurance as she
was able to run 60 miles a day with her dog team and walk the 45 miles to
Seward with a 40 pound pack in 11.5 hours.
The real legend of Alaska Nellie began in 1920 during a snowstorm while
waiting for the mail carrier. She eventually realized the mail carrier must be
in trouble and ventured out to find him. She found the man, took him back
to her cabin and thawed him out. She was given a gold nugget necklace
with a small diamond set in a star as reward for her heroic efforts. As the
train tracks were completed farther and farther north, Nellie moved with
them. In 1919, she had a roadhouse at Deadhorse (which eventually became
Curry) at milepost 248.5.
74
When President Warren G. Harding came to Alaska in 1923 to drive the
golden spike and commemorate the completion of the Railroad, he and his
wife wanted to meet Nellie. He was very impressed by the caribou head,
musk ox hide, bear hides, moose heads and other big game trophies she
had on display.
Nellie eventually purchased the village of Roosevelt just north of Seward
which she eventually renamed Lawing. The wealthy and famous of Europe
and America stayed with her at her lodge while on hunting trips.
In 1938, after the death of her husband, Nellie toured the U.S. to promote
Alaska. She eventually was the subject of a film in 1940 and in 1941 wrote an
autobiography. Alaska Nellie died in 1956 and left behind a legacy of
stories about life in a remote and wild Alaska during the first operating
years of the Alaska Railroad.
Nellie arrived in Seward on July 3, 1915, just as construction of the Alaska
Railroad was getting underway. She wrote in her autobiography, Alaska
Nellie, that she set out to seek a contract “to run the eating houses on the
southern end of the Alaska Railroad,” and she described her effort: “On my
first time out on an Alaskan trail, I had walked one hundred fifty miles and
as usual was alone. This accomplishment, in itself, might have satisfied
some, but I was out here in this great new country to contribute something
to others, and I felt this means could best be served by becoming the ‘Fred
Harvey’ of the government railroad in Alaska.”
Likely due in part to her plucky approach, she was awarded a lucrative
government contract to run a roadhouse at mile 44.9, a scenic location she
promptly named Grandview. Her agreement with the Alaska Engineering
Commission was to provide food and lodging for the government
employees; her skill with a rifle filled out the menu, and her gifted
storytelling kept her guests highly entertained. Nellie described the
accommodations at Grandview in her book, ‘Alaska Nellie’:
“The house was small but comfortable. A large room with thirteen bunks,
used as sleeping quarters for the men, was just above the dining room. A
small room above the kitchen served as my quarters. To the rear of the
building a stream of clear, cold water flowed down from the mountain and
was piped into the kitchen. Nature was surely in a lavish mood when she
created the beauty of the surroundings of this place. The timber-clad
mountains, the flower-dotted valley, the irresistible charm of the
continuous stretches of mountains and valleys was something in which to
revel.”
As work on the government railroad progressed, Nellie moved north and
operated a roadhouse near the Susitna River, at a railroad camp known as
Dead Horse. Because Dead Horse Hill was such a key location in the
construction of the Alaska Railroad, a large roadhouse was built at the site
in 1917 to accommodate the construction workers, officials, and occasional
visitors. Management of the new roadhouse was given to the intrepid
roadhouse keeper who had proven herself at Grandview.
Nellie took on running the Dead Horse Roadhouse with all the pluck and
dedication she’d shown at Grandview, cooking meals on two large ranges
for the dining room which seated 125 hungry workers at a time, and filling
60 lunch-buckets each night for the construction crews to take on their
jobs the following day. In her autobiography she wrote, “I dished out as
many as 12,000 to 14,000 meals per month, having two cooks, two
waitresses and several yard men as help.”
In his book about the era and the area, Lavish Silence, Kenneth Marsh
described the roadhouse accommodations: “…spring-less wooden bunks,
straw mattresses and oil- drum wood-burning stove, all in one large room at
the top of a flight of rickety stairs, held together by a warped wooden shell
(which, at times, put up an uneven fight against the elements).”
In July, 1923, President Harding, his wife, and Secretary of State Herbert
Hoover stayed at the Dead Horse Roadhouse on their way to the Golden
75
Spike-driving ceremony at Nenana. The next morning Nellie served heaping
plates of sourdough pancakes in her warm kitchen, commenting,
“Presidents of the United States like to be comfortable when they eat, just
like anyone else!”
“Before the Curry Hotel was built, Curry featured a famous old building
called the Dead Horse Roadhouse. The proprietor was the famous Alaska
Nellie, who was known for her incredible cooking abilities and
extraordinary hunting skills. It is said she killed the largest grizzly bear ever
seen at that time.” ~Steve Mahay, in The Legend of River Mahay
Finally in 1923, Nellie used her life’s savings to purchase her final home, a
roadhouse on Kenai Lake. The railroad stop along the blue-green waters
was renamed Lawing when Nellie Neal married Bill Lawing, and together
they built the roadhouse into a popular tourist stop on the Alaska Railroad.
Vegetables from Nellie’s garden were served with fresh fish from the lake
or with game from the nearby hills, and Nellie’s stories, often embellished
with her rollicking tall tales, kept her audiences delighted. Celebrities,
politicians, tourists and even locals came to enjoy the purely Alaskan
hospitality at the Lawings’ roadhouse on Kenai Lake.
Alaska Nellie became known far and wide, and the foreword to a 2010
reprinting of her autobiographical book, “Alaska Nellie,” by Patricia A. Heim,
sums up her legendary status:
“Nellie Neal Lawing was one of Alaska’s most charismatic, admired and
famous pioneers. She was the first woman ever hired by the U.S.
Government in Alaska in 1916. She was contracted to feed the hungry crews
on the long awaited Alaska railroad connecting Seward to Anchorage. The
conditions were harsh and supplies were limited. She delivered many of
her meals by dogsled, fighting off moose attacks and hazards of the trail,
often during below-zero blizzards. She always brought with her a great tale
to tell of her adventures along the trail, how she had wrestled grizzlies,
fought off wolves and moose, and caught the world’s largest salmon for
their dinner, always in the old sourdough tradition. The workers listened
and laughed with every bite.
“Nellie was an excellent cook, big game hunter, river guide, trail blazer, gold
miner, and a great story-teller! It wasn’t long before Nellie became
legendary and was known far and wide as the female ‘Davy Crockett’ of
Alaska, her wilderness adventures and stories of survival on the trail spread
like wildfire. Letters addressed simply ‘Nellie, Alaska’ were always
delivered.
“Nellie finally established herself at “Lawing, Alaska” on Kenai Lake, and
converted an old roadhouse into a museum for her multitude of big game
trophies. It was a great railroad stop and the highlight of any Alaskan visit.
Her guest register of over 15,000 read like the Who’s Who of the early
twentieth century: two U.S. Presidents, the Prince of Bulgaria, Will Rogers,
authors, generals and many silent-screen movie stars.
“Nellie would entertain them all. Colt pistol on her hip and a baby black
bear by her side, Nellie was always ready with one of her outrageous tales
of adventure. ‘I was just minding my own business on Kenai Lake when a
huge grizzly showed up, I fired my Colt, but as luck would have it, somehow,
it misfired, I then had to kick the heck out of the brute and he ran off, but
before he ran off he bit me good, right on the wrist, see here.’ She would
then fold back her sleeve to show a scarred arm.
“Nellie was so popular and loved that she was honored with an “Alaska
Nellie Day” on January 21, 1956.”
Nellie’s happiest days were spent with the love of her life, Bill Lawing, in
their log cabin on the shores of beautiful Kenai Lake. She fondly mentions it
in the opening paragraph of her autobiography, ‘Alaska Nellie’:
76
Glancing out through an open window of a large log home on the shores of
Kenai Lake at Lawing, Alaska, the rippling waves had become glittering
jewels in the full moonlight of a summer’s night.
Mountains covered with evergreen trees and crowned with snow were
reflected in the mirror-like water of Kenai Lake. Was I dreaming, or was the
curtain of the past rolling up, so that I might glance back over twenty-four
years spent in the great North-land and say, ‘No regrets.’”
Alaska Nellie’s grave is in the city cemetery in Seward, Alaska, a pretty
place at the base of the mountains, guarded by towering Sitka spruce trees.
Her gravestone bears the image of a pineapple, a symbol of hospitality
which began with the sea captains of New England, who sailed among the
Caribbean Islands and returned bearing cargos of fruits, spices and rum.
According to tradition in the Caribbean, the pineapple symbolized
hospitality, and sea captains learned they were welcome if a pineapple was
placed by the entrance to a village. At home, the captain would impale a
pineapple on a post near his home to signal friends he’d returned safely
from the sea, and would receive visits. As the tradition grew popular,
innkeepers added the pineapple to their signs and advertisements, and the
symbol for hospitality was further secured as needle-workers preserved
the image in family heirlooms such as tablecloths, doilies, potholders, door
knockers, curtain finials and more. It seems a fitting final tribute to a
legendary hostess of the north.
· When her pet black bear, Mike, was found dead with a brown bear
standing over him, she chased down the bear and killed it. As she told it:
"One night I went out to my barn to feed my little pet black bear, and I
found he was missing. As I went out into the snow, a huge shape lunged at
me. I twisted away and ran to the barn. As I tried to shut the door to keep
the big brown bear out, he smashed at the door with a paw, and it slammed
shut on my fingers. I remained inside for a while, and heard the bear catch
and kill my pet. Then I heard him drag the body away to bury it in a snow
bank. I couldn't stand it after that. I ran to the house, got my 30.06, and ran
back. He reared and started toward me and I had to shoot him six times
before he fell dead at my feet."
· She pulled a dog sled (with no dogs) for 30 miles to move supplies to her
roadhouse.
· Around the turn of the last century, this area was so remote that the mail
was delivered by dogsled in the winter. During a blizzard one winter, while
Nellie was running the Grandview section house, she began to worry when
the mail carrier didn’t show up at his usual time. As the blizzard worsened,
she couldn’t wait any longer, and she set out to look for him. She found him
a few miles away and he was nearly hypothermic! Nellie brought him, the
dogs, and the mail back to the Section House to care of him. Once he was
taken care of, she took the dogs out herself, into the snowstorm to deliver
the mail! The US Postmaster gave Nellie a commendation and the story
was reported in a New York paper. People from all over the world heard
about Nellie and her heroic efforts. Many wanted to write her, but no one
knew her address so they simply addressed them to “Nellie, Alaska” and
she was so well known that the fan mail would reach her.

· As a business woman, she built and managed a Roadhouse and charged
$.50 for dinners and $1.00 per night for lodging. (She was the first woman to
get a contract from the government to build a roadhouse on the railroad).
Nellie named the roadhouse Grandview and cut up an old blue coat, ironed
it, and sewed it on white cloth to make a sign.

· She built a museum to display all the animals she killed and skinned
(herself), then made it a tourist attraction for those traveling along the
Alaska railroad.
· Her way of getting dinner items together was putting a trout line in the
river with a bell on it. When the bell rang (meaning she snagged a fish), she
knew dinner was ready.
· The U.S. president Herbert Harding and his wife, Lou Henry Hoover were
guests at her roadhouse.
· Nellie tells another dog team story from her book: “One cold winter day in
December when the daylight was only a matter of minutes and the lamps
were burning low, two U.S. marshals, Marshals Cavanaugh and Irwin,
together with Jack Haley and Bob Griffiths, arrived at the roadhouse. The
heavy wooden boxes they were removing from their sleds had been
brought from the Iditarod mining district. They contained $750,000 in gold
bullion. “‘Where do you want to put this, Nellie?’ called the men, carrying
their precious burden. “‘Right here under the dining room table is as good a
place as any,’ I answered. And it was as simple as that. There it stayed until
the men carried it back to the sleds, next day. They were able to go to
sleep, for it was as safe right there in my dining room as it would have been
in the United States Mint. No one would dare to touch it.”

ARR HISTORY (Anywhere)
Construction of the Alaska Railroad began in 1904 as a private venture
founded by John E. Ballaine. Ballaine envisioned the Alaska Central as a
utilitarian railroad that would aid the general development of central
Alaska, help develop agriculture and timber, and give Fairbanks year-round
access to the 'Outside.' Additionally, the extensive Matanuska Valley coal
deposits could easily be transported to tidewater for the U.S. Navy and
export to world markets.
Ice-free Resurrection Bay was selected as the terminus of the railroad, and
the city of Seward and a port facility (sheet 1, Mile 0.0) were developed.
Recon- naissance surveys extended as far north as the Tanana River in
interior Alaska, and by 1909, track was laid across the Kenai Peninsula to
Kern Creek (Mile 70.5). The 2.2-percent grade from Mile49 to 54 past the
foot of Bartlett Glacier required the construction of seven tunnels, a
horseshoe trestle that curved 235°, and roadbed and trestles that looped
through 394° of total curvature.
The heavy construction costs severely strained the limited financial
resources of the Alaska Central, which was already subject to a federal levy
of $100/mi of tracklyr. The railroad also faced a completion deadline of 6 yr
from filing for a complete right-of-way to the Tanana River. Bickering and
speculation among the stockholders did not help. Any hope for the
tonnages required for a financially successful railroad vanished in 1906
when the federal government withdrew all Alaska coalfields from private
entry. By this decree, even the coal that fueled the locomotives had to be
imported! Bankruptcy for the Alaska Central occurred in 1909. After
reorganization, railroad construction (as the Alaska Northern) continued
before shutting down completely in 1912.
An engineering report published in 1916 com- mented favorably on the
location of the 71 mi (114 km) of track constructed by the Alaska Central.
However, the quality of construction was heavily criticized: "The roadbed is
in very bad physical condition - the rail is too light - embankments along the
rivers are too low and too narrow and many of the bridges were not
carefully constructed, spikes instead of bolts being used and the former
having shaken out, the trestles are now unsafe" (Alaska Engineering
Commission, 1916).
The conservation policies of President Theodore Roosevelt, particularly
the withdrawal of public lands
reviewed the guidebook and made many helpful sug- gestions. I especially
thank F.W. Weeks (Alaska Rail- road) for the opportunity to write this
guidebook and my old friends and former colleagues for their invaluable
help.
from private use, made it apparent that private capital could not build
adequate transportation facilities to interior Alaska. If interior Alaska was
to be developed, the government would need to construct and operate the
necessary transportation facilities. In 1912, a presi- dential commission
visited Alaska and reported to President Taft that they were in favor of
such construc- tion.
In 1914, passage of the Enabling Act empowered newly elected President
Woodrow Wilson to locate and construct a railroad (or railroads) that
would connect at least one Pacific Ocean port with a navigable river in
interior Alaska and with one or more coalfields [aggre- gate mileage not to
exceed 1,000mi (1,609km)]. Toac- complish this, the three-member Alaska
Engineering Commission was created. Wilson appointed William C. Edes as
chairman. Edes was unfamiliar with Alaska, but had an excellent reputation
as a locating engineer with several western railroads. The second member
of the Commission was Lt. Frederick Mears of the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers. Mears had considerable experience with the Great Northern
Railroad and the Panama Canal Railroad, but no experience in Alaska. The
third mem- ber was Thomas Riggs, who had considerable experience in
79
Alaska as a mining engineer and surveyor on the International Boundary
Commission.
Under the direction of these men, preliminary location surveys were
conducted in 1914 to select potential corridors for the construction of a
railroad to interior Alaska. Results were formally presented to Wilson on
February 11, 1915. The gentle terrain of the Goldstream valley was selected
for the corridor between Nenana and Fairbanks rather than a route along
the north side of the Tanana River. Today, with our knowl- edge of
permafrost, we would probably opt for hillside construction on a southfacing
slope rather than con- struction on the ice-rich soils of Goldstream
valley.
An evaluation of existing railroads was also included in the report to
Wilson. One such railroad was the 44.7-mi-long (72 km) narrow-gauge (3 ft;
92 cm) Tanana Valley Railroad built by private capital in 1905 to connect
various gold-mining camps in the Fairbanks area with the community of
Chena on the Tanana River. During construction, grading was minimized,
and valleys
were crossed on wooden trestles because of insufficient suitable
embankment material and the presence of permafrost. Despite heavy
maintenance costs, the Tanana Valley Railroad was a success until 1916,
when the grade of the rich placer deposits began to decline. The Tanana
Valley roadbed from Fairbanks to Happy (Mile 460 to 463) became part of
the Alaska Railroad standard-gauge main line. The remainder, designated as
the Chatanika Branch, continued to operate as a narrow- gauge branch line
until 1930, when it was abandoned.
After President Wilson selected and approved the Susitna route, which
included purchase of the Alaska Northern and the Tanana Valley Railroads,
the Commis- sion quickly surveyed the final route and began con- struction
in 1915. Edes established headquarters in Seward and oversaw construction
of the Alaska Rail- road. Mears moved to Ship Creek and laid out the
townsite of Anchorage, prepared facilities for receiving construction
materials and supplies, and began con- structing the line to the Matanuska
coalfields. Riggs, the surveying member of the Commission, traveled to
Fairbanks to walk every foot of the location surveys before he proposed a
final right-of-way between Broad Pass and Fairbanks. The first rolling stock
and construc- tion equipment came from the Panama Canal Railroad as
surplus.
The roadbed was constructed by station contract in which "a number of
men associate themselves together as partners, taking short pieces of work
at a certain price per cubic yard for grading, or per acre for clearing and
grubbing. Each man signs the contract for doing the work and becomes
equally interested in it as a co-partner or small contractor. Scarcely any
capital is necessary to make a station contract, as the Commission
furnishes the necessary equipment at a moderate rental" (Alaska
Engineering Commission, 1916). Such an arrangement effectively limited the
type of embankment material to that at hand. Commission forces handled
all bridge work and any trestle work required for high fills and laid the
track.
Specifications for construction contracts predict- ably stated, "All materials
taken from cuts shall be deposited in the embankment within the distance
prescribed by the Engineer." Only three classifications for excavated
materials were listed: loose rock, solid rock, and common excavation.
Although no classifica- tion was originally listed for excavation of frozen
material, its presence in the upper Chulitna - Broad Pass area was
acknowledged in the 1915 report. Native timber was used for ties and
timber trestles. In laying the main line with 70-lb (32 kg) rail, only the curves
had tie plates.
The construction years (1915 to 1923) saw an outstanding engineering
achievement marred by labor unrest, inflationary costs caused by
participation of the United States in World War I, the failure of Congress to
80
appropriate construction funds in a timely manner to meet limited
construction seasons, and intense personal and political bickering. The
initial $35 million appro- priated for railroad construction was $22.9 million
short of actual construction costs.
Commissioner Riggs resigned in 1918 to become Governor of the Territory
of Alaska after admitting that expediency sometimes governed
construction on the north end of the line. Chairman Edes resigned in 1919
because of ill health. Mears returned from France to become Chairman,
but was relieved of that post on March 26, 1923, just 3 mo before the
railroad was completed.
Erection of the 702-ft-long (214 m) truss span across the Tanana River at
Nenana marked completion of construction of the Alaska Railroad. On July
15, 1923: President Warren G. Harding drove the golden spike at the north
end of the bridge, officially marking the opening of the Alaska Railroad.
Although the completed railroad offered such immediate benefits as
bringing coal from the Suntrana fields near Healy (Mile 358) to the fuelstarved
gold- mining industry at Fairbanks, the expected resource
development in central Alaska did not materialize. Until 1940, the total
population of Alaska was less than 65,000. From 1923 to 1940, revenues for
the railroad fell below operating expenses in all but 1yr. Mainte- nance was
either deferred or severely modified; this included improvements slated for
miles of substandard roadbed and bridges constructed by the Commission
under the constraints of fixed federal appropriations and inflationary costs.
Funds that remained after meeting operating expenses were used to
replace large timber bridges with permanent steel structures.
With the onset of World War 11, the military arrived in Alaska in strength.
Supplying the military increased yearly tonnages dramatically, with a
corresponding effect on track and bridges. Increased revenues provided
funding for desperately needed maintenance, but a war-time manpower
shortage made it impossible to stop further deterioration of railroad
property.
Once again Congress was asked to consider the fate of the railroad, which
either had to be completely rebuilt or abandoned because it could no
longer function as a transportation system in its '1946' condition. Fairbanks
was totally dependent on Suntrana coal for its power and heat, and no
other energy alternatives were in sight. Anchorage, with its two military
bases, relied almost as heavily on coal from the Matanuska fields. There
were slightly more than a thousand miles of roads in the entire territory,
mostly substandard. The Alaska Railroad had to be rebuilt.
Under an ambitious rehabilitation program, the main line from Portage
(Mile 64.2) to Fairbanks (Mile 470.3) was to be rebuilt to modern standards.
(A de- cision t o rehabilitate the line from Portage t o Seward was made in
1954.) Heavy (115 Ib; 52 kg) rail would replace the worn 70-lb (32 kg) rail, and
treated-fir crossties would replace untreated native-spruce ties. Sags would
be eliminated by raising the track as much as 5 ft (1.5 m), and shoulders
would be widened to a standard 20 ft (6 m). The new track structure was
placed on 12in. (30cm) of select pit-run gravel to permit speeds as high as
60 mph (96 kmph). Surplus war material would be used to build new steel
bridges and shops and supply new rolling stock and heavy construction
equipment.
This effort outspent the money available, but not before many
improvements were made. However, the raises were reduced and the
shoulder-widening program cut back. The tie-replacement program was
stretched out because the railroad was mandated to maintain and rebuild
with revenues rather than with Congressional appropriations. Later, as new
track-maintenance equip- ment became available, manpower was reduced.
The Great Alaska Earthquake on March 27, 1964, caused heavy damage, but
subsequent repair work improved the line. Today's railroad, particularly its
equipment (figs. 2 and 3), is modern in many respects. High-production
surfacing equipment is used during the short construction season to offset
81
the legacy of poor subgrade conditions and prepare the track for the long
winter.
The 140 to 160 mi (225 to 290 km) of track that are raised, lined, and
dressed each summer equal a 3-yr ballasting cycle; the average figure for
other railroads in the United States is 5 yr.
Fifteen years ago, three track gangs of 1 0 men each were required to
augment the 25 section crews of two or three men each that maintained
the track through the winter. Today, only the regular section crews, each
patrolling an average of 20 mi (32 km) of track, are needed for necessary
winter maintenance.
By the early 1900’s, the territory of Alaska was already rich with natural
resource discoveries, including coal, gold and other minerals. What was
needed was a way to transport these valuable goods from interior Alaska
to the tidewater. In 1903, a privately held company called the Alaska
Central Railway began laying track north from the ice-free coastal town of
Seward. By 1909, the company had built about 50 miles of track before
going bankrupt and reorganizing as the Alaska Northern Railway. This
company added another 20 miles of track, ending near the present day
location of Girdwood. Goods were shipped along the railway from Seward,
then loaded into small boats and floated up the Turnagain Arm, but no
additional track was added.
In 1914, the United States Congress authorized construction of 470 miles of
rail line from Seward to Fairbanks. In 1915, the 70 miles of existing track was
purchased from Alaska Northern, and Anchorage was established as a
“tent city” railroad construction camp, as well as headquarters for the new
Alaska Railroad Corporation. The budget for the new railroad was $35
million, although the final cost would be nearly twice that amount. At its
peak in 1917, the railroad employed over 4,500 construction workers.
President Harding marked the official completion of the railroad by driving
in the final “golden spike” in the town of Nenana on July 15, 1923.
The railroad continued to play an important role in Alaska during World
War II, moving materials and supplies needed for the war effort in Alaska.
This included the construction of new military bases in Anchorage and
Fairbanks. During this time, two long tunnels were built to connect the
mainline with the additional ice-free port of Whittier. After the war ended,
the railway, suffering from the heavy use, received a well needed $100
million renovation and upgrade.
On March 27, 1964 the Alaska Good Friday earthquake caused nearly $30
million dollars in damage to the Alaska Railroad, with the greatest impact
focused south of Anchorage. The magnitude 9.2 quake, the largest ever
recorded in North America, wiped out rail facilities in Whittier and Seward,
twisted tracks, and damaged bridges up and down the line.
In May of 1984, the railroad began pulling privately owned “superdome”
train cars for a company called Tour Alaska. This started a trend, and today
there are over 25 custom built full dome railcars cars in use, including the
privately owned McKinley Explorer and Wilderness Express as well as the
Alaska Railroad’s own GoldStar domes.
In January of 1985, the State of Alaska purchased the railroad from the
federal government for $22.3 million, investing an additional $70 million in
the coming years for needed repairs and improvements. In 2000, the
82
longer Whittier tunnel was upgraded to handle alternating own-way rail and
vehicle traffic. During the Clinton administration there were discussions
about the possibility of connecting the “lower 48” with Alaska by rail, but
little progress has been made. Expansion of rail service in the MatSu Valley
and from Fairbanks to Delta Junction is in the works.
The Alaska Railroad, the northernmost railroad in the United Sates, begins
in Seward, follows the Turnagain Arm, and ends within 120 miles of the
Arctic Circle in Fairbanks. While the railroad covers quite a few miles, the
only route is in the corridor between Seward and Fairbanks.
With construction of the railroad beginning in 1915, the job took
approximately 5,000 people and about eight years to complete, it was
done in 1923. Financed and constructed by the federal government, the
railroad tab totaled $56,000,000 or $78,000 per mile. Although the
Seward Highway serves as the main thoroughfare from Anchorage to
Seward, prior to the construction of the highway, the train was the only way
to reach Seward and other areas of the Kenai Peninsula.
As we continue along our trip today I would like to take a moment to tell
you about the construction of the Alaska Railroad. Let’s start the story way
back in 1867, that’s when The United States purchased Alaska from the
Russians for $7.2 million dollars. William H. Seward, who was Secretary of
State at the time, arranged the transaction. Today we know that the U.S. got
quite a good deal, but back then most folks thought the purchase of Alaska
was a big mistake. They thought Alaska was nothing but a frozen wasteland.
In fact, the purchase of Alaska was commonly referred to as Seward’s Folly!
From 1867 to the turn of the century, Alaska lacked any reliable means of
transportation. We had no way to get our natural resources to market. The
gold rush of 1898 brought attention to Alaska remoteness, rugged terrain
and inaccessibility. Travel by river was only 4 months of the year. The few
trails which existed were primitive and torturous. This hurt the growth of
our economy greatly. Several attempts had been made by private
companies to build a railroad in Alaska, all but two (Whitepass Yukon and
Copper River railroads) ended in failure, due to high construction costs. At
the turn of the century many thought it outrageous that a territory over
two and a half times as large as Texas was without a railroad. Many people
thought that a railroad was so important to the development of Alaska, that
if the private sector couldn’t do it, the government should. Finally in March
1914, after extensive lobbying efforts, the Federal Government
appropriated funds to complete the rail line and created the Alaska
Railroad. At the completion of the Panama Canal, (Jan 1914) all the excess
equipment and manpower were transferred to Alaska. At the peak of
construction 4500 workers were employed. Col. Mears of the Army Corps
of Engineers was selected to build the ARR. The approved route originated
in the deep-water, ice-free port of Seward, on the Kenai Peninsula and
extended north along Turnagain Arm, into the coalfields of the Matanuska
Valley and ultimately ended in the interior city of Fairbanks. Construction
of the Alaska Railroad was completed in 1923. President Warren G. Harding
came to Alaska in July of 1923 and drove the golden spike in the town of
Nenana commemorating the completion of the Alaska Railroad. It took
approximately eight years and cost $70 million, or nearly $1 billion in 2012
dollars! Interestingly enough, at the time of completion, the combined
populations of the three major towns on its route, Seward, Anchorage, and
Fairbanks were only 5,400 people. The Alaska Railroad was of great value
during WWII to transport military personnel, civilians and equipment.
However, due to heavy usage during this time, it needed to be rebuilt. Part
of this rehabilitation was to replace old equipment. In 1944, the Railroad
bought its first two diesel engines to start replacing the steam engines that
had been used up until this time. The last steam engine was sold in 1964.
83
(The last steam engine used on the ARR was the 557 and was recently
donated back to the Alaska Railroad. Once the 557 is restored, the Railroad
plans on using it for tours and excursions.) This was the first and only
railroad built and run by the United States Federal Government. In fact, the
U.S. Department of the Interior ran the Alaska Railroad until the 1980’s. In
1985, the State of Alaska bought the Alaska Railroad for $22.3 million. Now a
board of directors appointed by the Governor of Alaska runs the Alaska
Railroad. Gold was discovered in the Klondike region of the Yukon on Aug
16, 1896. 100K people attempted to get there. 30-40K made it to Dawson,
only 4K found gold and a few hundred became rich. The peak of the “rush”
lasted one year from the summer of 1897 until the summer of 1898. It ended
as quickly as it began with the discovery of gold in Nome in 1899.
As I mentioned earlier Anchorage owes its beginnings in 1915 to the Alaska
Railroad, but construction of the Railroad has a little more history behind it.
Let’s start the story back in 1867, that’s when The United States purchased
Alaska from the Russians for $7.2 million dollars. William H. Seward, who
was Secretary of State at the time, arranged the deal. Today we know that

TELEGRAPH POLES/WAMCATS/ACS
You may have noticed old telegraph poles to our (3:00NB/9:00SB) side.
We will be following these telegraph poles almost all the way into
Fairbanks, and if you were to ride the train to Seward you would see these
poles following the tracks along there as well. These poles were built
beginning in 1914 and were connected to an original telegraph system that
was built to connect Alaska to the lower 48 and was started in May 1900.
The first segment, from Eagle to Nome, was completed under the direction
of Lt. Billy Mitchell in 1903. The telegraph system became known as the
Washington Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS) and
was re-designated the Alaska Communications System (ACS) in 1936.
WAMCATS/ACS managed both military and civilian messages – in fact, in
1906, of the 300,000 messages being handled, only 1/5 were military in
nature.
Along the rail belt, there were 35-40 poles constructed per mile, with 1,890
poles built in 1918 alone! Before the Railroad had wireless radio
communications, train crews would use these telegraph poles to
communicate with the different railroad stations. To send or receive
messages, the conductor would reach out with a long pole that had a small
bit of wire on the end and connect the wired end to the telegraph lines.
ACS remained a military-run communications program until it was bought
by RCA in 1971 and re-named Alascom. Digital switching was introduced to
Alaska in 1989, and the last telegraph office in Alaska closed down in 1993.
There are three satellites dedicated to providing telecommunications in
Alaska. (The satellites were launched by Alascom in 1982, 1991, and 2000).
TOUR GUIDE PROGRAM (Anywhere)
(Tour guide info can also be discussed after Trail glacier when switching
with another tour guide)
Some of you may be curious about my job as an Alaska Railroad Tour
Guide. The Alaska Railroad Tour Guide program started in 1980 with the
Anchorage and Fairbanks School Districts. The Alaska Railroad funds this
program with an instructor provided by the school district to teach an 11-
week program. Tour Guides that work on the railroad go through a
screening process and must meet several criteria including being a junior or
senior with a 2.5 GPA or higher. Then students, after successful completion
of the class, are interviewed to be hired by the railroad. Those that aren’t
chosen are provided assistance in an attempt to find other employment
within the tourism industry. At this time the Alaska Railroad has an
education partnership with the Anchorage School District, but it has
included Fairbanks and Seward in the past. This education partnership has
set the standard for many other education partnerships nationwide. If you
have any more specific questions regarding this program feel free to ask!

CAPTAIN COOK STORY (Cook Inlet, Turnagain Arm)
Although the Turnagain arm developed into a popular route for early
Russian fur traders and Alaska Natives, Western Europeans only
discovered the Turnagain Arm after Captain James Cook sailed into this
area of Alaska in 1778.
In search of the Northwest Passage, a passageway connecting the Pacific
Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean, Captain Cook sailed one of his ships, the
Resolution, into this area. As he made his way up the arm, Captain Cook
soon discovered that the body of water was not the Northwest Passage but
rather a river of some sort as he could not see further inland. After his
revelation, Cook had to “turn again” to safely get his ship out of the arm in
his quest for an alternate route to Asia.
After hearing of Captain Cook’s discovery, Captain George Vancouver, an
extremely knowledgeable navigator, retraced Captain Cook’s voyage up
“Cook’s River” and discovered that the river was indeed an arm of the sea.
From that point on, British maps showed the body of water as Turnagain
Arm. Turnagain Arm drains into the Gulf of Alaska and then finally into the
Pacific Ocean.
As I've mentioned, the body of water we’ve been following is known as
Turnagain Arm, and it flows into Cook Inlet. Captain James Cook inspired
the name for it back in 1778. At the time, Captain Cook was on his third
voyage of discovery for the King of England. His mission was to sail through
the South Pacific and claim any new islands discovered in the name of
England, then sail north exploring the Pacific Coast, searching for the
fabled Northwest Passage. In Cook’s time, it was believed that a major
waterway connected the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. If this waterway
existed, it would dramatically shorten the time it would take for ships to sail
between Europe and the Orient. So, many explorers were hoping to be the
first to find the Northwest Passage, including Cook. Captain Cook set sail
from England aboard the ship the Discovery. (Accompanying him was
renowned artist of the day John Webber, and a midshipman who would
eventually find his own fame as a world explorer, George Vancouver.)
Sailing with the Discovery was a second ship, the Resolution, commanded
by William Bligh. The two ships sailed into the South Pacific, then north
along the coast of Alaska, exploring the many waterways hoping to find the
fabled Northwest Passage.
When Captain Cook and his men reached what we now know as Cook
Inlet, they were tired and discouraged. Though Cook was doubtful that
this body of water was the supposed Northwest Passage, on the urging of
his men, he sailed up into Cook Inlet until he got to the point where
Anchorage now sits and the inlet split into two arms. He sent Captain Bligh
up the northern section of Cook Inlet, which was then and still today
known as Knik Arm, and Cook sailed into the body of water we see to our
9:00 side. The silt that fills this valley creates a very “anfractuous” channel
(twisting and turning, yet never breaking) that snakes along the arm
Captain Cook had to continually “turn again” to stay within the deepest
86
part of the channel. When he reached the end of the arm, realizing that it
was indeed, not the fabled passage, he sadly wrote in his journal that he
had to “turn again” and named this body of water Turnagain River. Years
later, George Vancouver navigated this waterway and determined it to be a
part of Cook Inlet and changed the name to Turnagain Arm. The Cook Inlet
is fed by the Susitna, Matanuska, and Kenai rivers. The Turnagain Arm is fed
mostly by Twentymile River, Portage River, and the Placer River.
When Captain Cook met up again with William Bligh they continued on
exploring Alaska's coastline into October of 1778. By then the winter ice
flows were threatening the boats so Captain Cook decided to sail back to
the Hawaiian Islands to wait out the winter. He planned to return to Alaska
and the Russian Kamchatka Peninsula to continue searching for the
Northwest Passage the following spring. However, during this return trip to
the Hawaiian Islands a confrontation broke out between the Hawaiians and
Captain Cook and his men. This fight resulted in Captain Cook's death. At
51 years old, Captain Cook had spent more than 30 years of his life at sea
and opened up a world of undiscovered lands. Many of Captain Cook's
maps and drawings were so accurate they are still accepted today. And
many places in Alaska still bare the name that Captain Cook gave them.
Ironically, William Bligh's name seems to be synonymous, throughout
history, with disaster. He was with Captain Cook on his failed voyage to
Alaska and he was with Captain Cook when Cook was killed in the
Hawaiian Islands. Later Captain Bligh's men mutinied on him when he was
Captain of the ship the Bounty; some of you may be familiar with the book
Mutiny on the Bounty. Historical note. Bligh and 18 men were put in a 23
foot uncovered launch which was so heavily loaded the gunwales were only
inches above the water! With only a compass and quadrant he sailed 3,618
miles, a 47 day voyage. He lost one crew member to hostile natives and one
to malaria. This sailing feat is unmatched in history. And lastly, in 1989, while
maneuvering to avoid floating ice from Columbia Bay, the Exxon Valdez Oil
Tanker ran aground on none other than Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound,
spilling 11 million gallons of oil, causing the worst oil spill in our nation's
history!
Cook’s two ships, the Discovery and Resolution, had worked their way
northwest from what is now Oregon and Puget Sound, along the British
Columbia and Alaska coast, hoping to find the long-sought Northwest
Passage.
They were in Cook Inlet by late May and early June 1778, hoping it would
lead to the imagined passageway to Europe. It didn’t, once again, but Cook
sent his crew exploring in small boats, which led to the naming of Turnagain
Arm, so named because it was a disappointing “turn again” for Cook’s crew
(Cook originally called it “River Turnagain”.
William Bligh, later of Bounty fame, was a master’s mate in Cook’s crew and
led the boat crew exploring what is now Knik Arm, reporting the discovery
of a large river at its head (either the Matanuska or Knik Rivers) as well as
beautiful mountain scenery to the north, possibly the Alaska Range and
even Denali, known to the Lower 48 as Mt. McKinley.
Cook’s ships were in the Inlet for just over a week, long enough to establish
that this wasn’t the Northwest Passage. While here, though, Cook took
time to land at what is now Point Possession on the Kenai Peninsula to
proclaim the region for English. That happened on June 1, 1778, where his
crew claimed possession of the area in front of dozens of puzzled local
residents, the Dena’ina. It was the first significant encounter between
Europeans and Dena’ina.
The visit to Cook Inlet was part of Cook’s longer exploration of the Alaska
coast from which included a stop in Prince William Sound, which Cook
named, along with Bligh Reef in the Sound, which was to become famous in
1989 when the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on it and spilled millions of
gallons of crude oil.
87
Prince William Sound, interestingly, was almost named “Sandwich Sound”
by Cook after the Earl of Sandwich in England (and who invented the
sandwich as a food item). The Sound was renamed by Cook after Prince
William, a scion of the royal family when his journal was published.
Leaving Prince William Sound, Cook ventured west along the Alaska coast
in subsequent exploration, and after leaving Cook Inlet, he named Bristol
Bay and Norton Sound and other features after places and people in
England, as was the custom at the time.
As he continued his quest for the Northwest Passage Cook entered the
Chukchi Sea through the Bering Strait and, amazingly, got as far as Icy
Cape, on Alaska’s northwest coast, before being stopped by ice. The two
ships were almost trapped by ice off Icy Cape, in fact.

THE SPELL OF THE YUKON
BY ROBERT W. SERVICE
I wanted the gold, and I sought it;
I scrabbled and mucked like a slave.
Was it famine or scurvy—I fought it;
I hurled my youth into a grave.
I wanted the gold, and I got it— ﻿
Came out with a fortune last fall,—
Yet somehow life’s not what I thought it,
And somehow the gold isn’t all.
No! There’s the land. (Have you seen it?)
It’s the cussedest land that I know,
From the big, dizzy mountains that screen it
To the deep, deathlike valleys below.
Some say God was tired when He made it;
Some say it’s a fine land to shun;
Maybe; but there’s some as would trade it
For no land on earth—and I’m one.
You come to get rich (damned good reason);
You feel like an exile at first;
You hate it like hell for a season,
And then you are worse than the worst.
It grips you like some kinds of sinning;
It twists you from foe to a friend;
It seems it’s been since the beginning;
It seems it will be to the end.
I’ve stood in some mighty-mouthed hollow
That’s plumb-full of hush to the brim;
I’ve watched the big, husky sun wallow
In crimson and gold, and grow dim,
Till the moon set the pearly peaks gleaming,
And the stars tumbled out, neck and crop;
And I’ve thought that I surely was dreaming,
With the peace o’ the world piled on top.
The summer—﻿no sweeter was ever;
The sunshiny woods all athrill;
The grayling aleap in the river,
The bighorn asleep on the hill.
The strong life that never knows harness;
The wilds where the caribou call;
The freshness, the freedom, the farness—﻿
O God! how I’m stuck on it all.
The winter! the brightness that blinds you,
The white land locked tight as a drum,
The cold fear that follows and finds you,
The silence that bludgeons you dumb.
The snows that are older than history,
The woods where the weird shadows slant;
The stillness, the moonlight, the mystery,
I’ve bade ’em good-by—﻿but I can’t.
92
There’s a land where the mountains are nameless,
And the rivers all run God knows where;
There are lives that are erring and aimless,
And deaths that just hang by a hair;
There are hardships that nobody reckons;
There are valleys unpeopled and still;
There’s a land—﻿oh, it beckons and beckons,
And I want to go back—﻿and I will.
They’re making my money diminish;
I’m sick of the taste of champagne.
Thank God! when I’m skinned to a finish
I’ll pike to the Yukon again.
I’ll fight—﻿and you bet it’s no sham-fight;
It’s hell!—﻿but I’ve been there before;
And it’s better than this by a damsite—﻿
So me for the Yukon once more.
There’s gold, and it’s haunting and haunting;
It’s luring me on as of old;
Yet it isn’t the gold that I’m wanting
So much as just finding the gold.
It’s the great, big, broad land ’way up yonder,
It’s the forests where silence has lease;
It’s the beauty that thrills me with wonder,
It’s the stillness that fills me with peace.
93
THE CREMATION OF SAM MCGEE
BY ROBERT W. SERVICE
There are strange things done in the midnight sun
By the men who moil for gold;
The Arctic trails have their secret tales
That would make your blood run cold;
The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,
But the queerest they ever did see
Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge
I cremated Sam McGee.
Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee,
where the cotton blooms and blows.
Why he left his home in the South to roam
'round the Pole, God only knows.
He was always cold, but the land of gold
seemed to hold him like a spell;
Though he'd often say in his homely way
that "he'd sooner live in hell."
On a Christmas Day we were mushing
our way over the Dawson trail.
Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold
it stabbed like a driven nail.
If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze
till sometimes we couldn't see;
It wasn't much fun, but the only one
to whimper was Sam McGee.
And that very night, as we lay packed tight
in our robes beneath the snow,
And the dogs were fed, and the stars o’erhead
were dancing heel and toe,
He turned to me, and "Cap," says he,
"I'll cash in this trip, I guess;
And if I do, I'm asking that you
won't refuse my last request."
Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no;
then he says with a sort of moan:
"It's the cursèd cold, and it's got right hold
till I'm chilled clean through to the bone.
Yet 'tain't being dead—it's my awful dread
of the icy grave that pains;
So I want you to swear that, foul or fair,
you'll cremate my last remains."
A pal's last need is a thing to heed,
so I swore I would not fail;
And we started on at the streak of dawn;
but God! he looked ghastly pale.
He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day
of his home in Tennessee;
And before nightfall a corpse was all
that was left of Sam McGee.
94
There wasn't a breath in that land of death,
and I hurried, horror-driven,
With a corpse half hid that I couldn't get rid,
because of a promise given;
It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say:
"You may tax your brawn and brains,
But you promised true, and it's up to
you to cremate those last remains."
Now a promise made is a debt unpaid,
and the trail has its own stern code.
In the days to come, though my lips were dumb,
in my heart how I cursed that load.
In the long, long night, by the lone firelight,
while the huskies, round in a ring,
Howled out their woes to the homeless snows -
O God! how I loathed the thing.
And every day that quiet clay
seemed to heavy and heavier grow;
And on I went, though the dogs were spent
and the grub was getting low;
The trail was bad, and I felt half mad,
but I swore I would not give in;
And I'd often sing to the hateful thing,
and it hearkened with a grin.
Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge,
and a derelict there lay;
It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice
it was called the "Alice May."
And I looked at it, and I thought a bit,
and I looked at my frozen chum;
Then "Here," said I, with a sudden cry,
"is my cre-ma-tor-eum."
Some planks I tore from the cabin floor,
and I lit the boiler fire;
Some coal I found that was lying around,
and I heaped the fuel higher;
The flames just soared, and the furnace roared -
such a blaze you seldom see;
And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal,
and I stuffed in Sam McGee.
Then I made a hike, for I didn't like
to hear him sizzle so;
And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled,
and the wind began to blow.
It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled
down my cheeks, and I don't know why;
And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak
went streaking down the sky.
95
I do not know how long in the snow
I wrestled with grisly fear;
But the stars came out and they danced about
ere again I ventured near;
I was sick with dread, but I bravely said:
"I'll just take a peep inside.
I guess he's cooked, and it's time I looked”;
... then the door I opened wide.
And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm,
in the heart of the furnace roar;
And he wore a smile you could see a mile,
and he said: "Please close that door.
It's fine in here, but I greatly fear
you'll let in the cold and storm—
Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee,
it's the first time I've been warm."
There are strange things done in the midnight sun
By the men who moil for gold;
The Arctic trails have their secret tales
That would make your blood run cold;
The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,
But the queerest they ever did see
Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge
I cremated Sam McGee.

THE BALLAD OF CASEY JONES
BY WALLACE SAUNDERS
“Come, all you rounders, if you want to hear
The story told of a brave engineer;
Casey Jones was the rounder’s name,
A high right-wheeler of mighty fame.”
Of mighty fame, of mighty fame,
A high right-wheeler of mighty fame.
Casey pulled into the Memphis yard
Fed up, beat down and dog tired,
Another driver had called in sick,
Asking Casey to do a double trick.
Casey smiled, said, “I’m feelin’ fine,
Gonna ride that train to the end of the line.
There’s ridges and bridges, and hills to climb,
Got a head of steam and ahead of time.”
Ahead of time, ahead of time.
Got a head of steam and ahead of time.
Caller called Casey, half-past four;
He kissed his wife, the station door,
Climbed into the cab, orders in his hand,
“Could be my trip to (the) Promised Land.”
Through South Memphis on the fly,
The fireman say, “You got a white eye.”
The switchmen knew the engine’s moan
The man at the throttle was Casey Jones.
Was Casey Jones, was Casey Jones.
The man at the throttle was Casey Jones.
The engine rocked, the drivers rolled,
Fireman hollered, “Save my soul!”
“I’m gonna roll her ‘til she leaves the rails,
I’m behind time with the Southern mail.
Been raining hard for weeks and weeks;
Railroad track like the bed of a creek.
Rated down to a thirty-mile gait —
The Southern mail two hours late.
Two hours late, two hours late.
The Southern mail was two hours late.
Fireman say, “You running (too) fast.
You ran the last three lights we passed.
Casey say, “We’ll make it through,
She’s steamin’ better than I ever knew.”
Casey say, “Don’t you fret.
Keep feedin’ the fire; don’t give up yet.
Run her ‘til she leaves the rail.
To be on time with the Southern mail.
The Southern Mail, the Southern mail.
To be on time with the Southern mail.
Checked his water, his water was low,
Looked at his watch, his watch was slow.
Put on more water, put on more coal,
Put your head out the window see my drivers roll.
See my drivers roll, see my drivers roll,
Put your head out the window see my drivers roll.
People said Casey couldn’t run
But I can tell you what Casey done;
97
Left Memphis, quarter ‘til nine
Vaughn, Mississippi, right on time.
Got within a mile of the place,
A big headlight stared him in the face;
Shout to the fireman, “Jump for your life.”
Give my love to my children, say goodbye to my wife.
Casey said, just before he died,
“There’s a lot more railroads that I’d like to ride;”
He said the good Lord whispered, “It’ll never be,”
The Illinois Central be the death of me.
Headaches and heartaches and all kinds of pain
Ain’t no different from a railroad train.
You can take your stories, noble and grand,
All just a part of a railroad man…..

MYTHS AND LEGENDS
THE NAMING OF THE BIRDS - TLINGIT (WRANGELL)
NOW Raven went around among the birds, teaching them. He said to
Grouse, "You are to live in a place where it is wintry. You will always live in a
place high up so you will have plenty of breezes." Then Raven gave Grouse
four white pebbles. He said, "You will never starve so long as you have
these four pebbles." Raven also said to Grouse, "You know that Sea-lion is
your grandchild. You must get four more pebbles and give them to him."
That is why the sea-lion has four large pebbles. It throws these at hunters. If
one strikes a person, it kills him. From this story it is known that Grouse and
Sea-lion understand each other.
Raven said to Ptarmigan, "You will be the maker of snowshoes. You will
know how to travel in snow." It was from these birds that the Athapascans
learned how to make snowshoes and how to put the lacings on.
Raven came next to Wild Canary, that lives all the year around in the Tlingit
country. He said, "You will be head among the very small birds. You are not
to live on the same food as human beings. Keep away from them."
Then Raven said to Robin, "You will make people happy by your whistle.
You will be a good whistler."
Then Raven said to Kun, the Flicker, "You will be chief among the birds of
your size. You will not be found in all places. You will seldom be seen."
Raven said to Lugan, a bird that lives far out on the ocean, "You will seldom
be seen near shore. You will live on lonely rocks, far out on the ocean."
When Raven came to Snipes, he said, "You will always go in flocks. You will
never go out alone." Therefore we always see snipes in flocks.
Raven said to Asq-aca-tci, a small bird with yellowgreen plumage, "You will
always go in flocks. You will always be on the tree tops. That is where your
food is."
Raven said to a very small bird, Kotlai, the size of a butterfly, "You will be
liked. You will be seen only to give good luck. People will hear your voice,
but seldom see you."
Then to Blue-jay Raven said, "You will have very fine clothes. You will be a
good talker. People will take colors from your clothes."
Then Raven said to Xunkaha, "You will never be seen unless the north wind
is going to blow." That is what the name Xunkaha means.
To Crow, Raven said, "You will make lots of noise. You will be great talkers."
That is why, when you hear one crow, you hear a lot of others right
afterward.
Raven said to Gusyiadul, "You will be seen only when warm weather is
coming. Never come near except when warm weather is coming."
To Hummingbird Raven said, "People will enjoy seeing you. If a person sees
you once, he will want to see you again."
Raven said to Eagle, "You will be very powerful and above all birds. Your
eyesight will be very good. It will be easy for you to get what you want."
99
Then Raven put talons on the eagle and said they would be useful to him.
Thus Raven taught all the birds.

RAVEN AND MARMOT - ESKIMO (BERING STRAITS)
ONCE Raven was flying over a reef near the seashore, near seabirds that
were perched on the rocks. Seabirds cried to him, "Oh, you offaleater! Oh,
you carrion-eater! Oh, you black one!"
Raven turned and flew far away crying, "Qaq! qaq! qaq!" He flew far away
across the great water until he came to a mountain on the other side.
Raven saw just in front of him the hole of Marmot. Then Raven stood by the
door watching, until Marmot came home, bringing food. But Marmot could
not enter his hole because Raven stood in the way. Marmot asked Raven to
stand to one side.
Raven said, "No. They called me ' carrion-eater.' Now I will show them I am
not. I will eat you."
Marmot said, "All right, but I have heard that you are a very fine dancer.
Now, if you will dance, I will sing. Then you can eat me, but let me see you
dance before you eat me."
Raven agreed to dance. Then Marmot sang, "Oh, Raven, Raven, Raven, how
well you dance! Oh, Raven, Raven, Raven, how well you dance!"
Raven danced. Then they stopped to rest.
Marmot said, "I like your dancing. Now I will sing again, so shut your eyes
and dance your best." So Raven shut his eyes and danced clumsily around.
Marmot sang, "Oh, Raven, Raven, Raven, what a graceful dancer! Oh, Raven,
Raven, Raven, what a fool you are!" Because Marmot, with a quick run, had
darted between Raven's legs and was safe in his hole.
When Marmot was safe in his hole, he put out the tip of his nose and
mocked Raven. He said, "Chikik-kik, chi-kik-kik, chi-kik-kik! You are the
greatest fool I ever saw. What a comical figure you cut when dancing! I
could hardly keep from laughing. Just look at me — see how fat I am. Don't
you wish you could eat me?"
Raven, in a rage, flew far away.
BEAVER AND PORCUPINE - TSIMSHIAN
NOW Beaver was the friend of Porcupine. Much they loved each other.
Then Beaver invited Porcupine to his house on the large lake. There in the
very middle of the lake was the house of Beaver. Now Beaver, on his part,
liked the water, but Porcupine had no way to go from the shore to the lake,
because he knew not how to swim. Therefore feared Porcupine that he
should die should his stomach be filled with water, because he knew not
how to swim. Therefore this did Beaver: from the lake to the land he went
for Porcupine. Only twice rose Beaver above the water, going to where
Porcupine was sitting on the shore.
Then said Beaver to Porcupine, “I carry you. Fast hold my neck.”
Porcupine was afraid. He said to Beaver, “I might die.”
“You shall not die.” Thus said the Beaver to the Porcupine.
Then went up Porcupine to the back of Beaver.
Beaver said, “Fast hold my neck.”
Myths and L 37 egends of Alaska, edited by Katharine Berry Judson (1911)
100
Thus did Porcupine. Then swam Beaver out on the water. But not long did
he swim. Beaver dived. Then much troubled was Porcupine because he
knew not how to swim. Now the Beavers really own the country of the
water, but among the mountains is the country of Porcupine.
Twice rose Beaver above the water. Then reached he the middle of the
great lake where floated his home. But much troubled was Porcupine, lest
he die in the water. Then they entered the house of Beaver. Then they ate.
Now this for food had the Beaver: sticks were the food for his feast. Then
really troubled was the Porcupine, there to eat sticks. Yet Porcupine ate
the stick.
Well, then one day, said Beaver to Porcupine: “Friend, now we play.”
Then said Beaver how he would play: “I carry you. Four times I emerge from
the water.”
“Surely I die.” Thus said the heart of Porcupine. Yet he agreed.
Beaver said, “Fast hold to my neck. Lie close against the nape of my neck.”
Then was ready the heart of Porcupine to die. Then dived Beaver. Yet first
struck he the water with his tail. Thus he first splashed water into the face
of
Porcupine. Then dived Beaver. Long was he under water. Then a little dead
was Porcupine. His stomach was full of water. Three times the Beaver rose
from the water. Then only once more remained. Then again dived Beaver.
Almost dead was Porcupine. Then with him he returned. From lake to land
he took him.
Then Porcupine went back to his tribe. When again he reached his tribe, to
his house he invited the people. Then into the house of Porcupine went the
invited ones. Then he told them what Beaver had done in his great house
on the lake. He told the people what Beaver, who had invited him, had
done. He said, “Almost dead was I through my friend.”
Then said his people, “Good! You also invite him. Also play with him.”
This did Porcupine. He also invited Beaver, his friend. To the house of
Beaver did he send. Then came Beaver into the valley. Up he went. Then
came he to the house of Porcupine. Then this did Porcupine: when Beaver
entered into the house, Porcupine struck on the fireplace with his own tail.
Then it burnt. Then Beaver made a song:
“In the middle burnt the tail of little Porcupine, pa!
In the middle burnt the tail of little Porcupine.”
Then ran Porcupine around in front of Beaver to play with his friend. Now
when this was finished, what did the Porcupine? He got food for the Beaver
to eat. Then this did the Porcupine: bark of a tree and leaves of a tree did
he give him for a feast. Then, on his part, Beaver was afraid to eat. Then
this said the Porcupine to his great friend, Beaver: “Eat fast, friend. Eat fast,
friend.” Then so did the Beaver.
Then said Porcupine, “Friend,”—thus said he to Beaver—“to-morrow
morning we play, you and I. There stands a tree on a grassy slope. There is
my playground.”
Then they slept. But Porcupine sang,
“Now along the edge I walk . . . out falls my shooting star.”
Then spoke Porcupine to the sky, and the sky did so. Clear became the sky.
The ground was ice in the morning.
Now again Porcupine invited the people to a feast for great Beaver. Then
Porcupine said, “We play, friend. There stands my playground.”
Now very sharp was the cold. The ground was ice. Where water ran down,
slippery was it with ice. But Beaver followed Porcupine. Then again was
Beaver troubled. Always slippery were his hands, but long were the claws
of Porcupine. Then Porcupine returned to see great Beaver. Then said
Porcupine, “Come, do it, friend.” Thus said Porcupine to great Beaver. But
the Beaver could not cross, because icy was the mountain. Then this did
the Porcupine: he took the hands of Beaver, then across he led him. Thus
across he got. Porcupine was going to play with Beaver, just as he also did
once. So they reached the place where stood the tree.
101
“Good! Go up!” Thus said Porcupine to Beaver. Then much troubled was
Beaver. He was afraid.
“Well! See!” Thus said Porcupine. So Porcupine went up first. Up he went to
the very top. Then he let go the top of the tree. As soon as he dropped,
this he said, while coming down:
“An-de-be-laq! An-de-be-laq!”
Then he dropped on a stone, but arose. Not dead was he!
Then said Porcupine to Beaver, “See, friend! It is not hard.”
Then up on the tree carried he Beaver. He said, “Fast hold to my neck.”
And very fast he held to the neck of Porcupine. Then when Porcupine
reached near the top of the tree, he put Beaver on a branch. Then greatly
afraid was Beaver for his hands were not good for holding fast to a tree.
Only a Porcupine knows that, because long are his claws.
Then thus said Porcupine: “Really hold fast, friend. I go down first.” The
Beaver did so. All around the branch were his hands. Then Porcupine let go
the tree. Into space he went. Again he said,
“An-de-be-laq! An-de-be-laq!”
Then once more he dropped on the stones, but not dead was he!
Much troubled was the heart of great Beaver, in holding the branch. Much
troubled was he at falling. Then about the foot of the tree ran Porcupine.
Then up he looked to where was his friend. Thus said Porcupine: “Go on,
friend. It is not hard. Look at me. Not dead am I because I fell!”
Then Beaver let go the branch. Thus said Beaver as he fell,
“Loop! Lo-op!” (“Stone! Stone!”)
Then Beaver struck the rocks. He lay on his back. He was dead.

SUKDU, OR TRADITIONAL DENA’INA STORIES
One Dena’ina story tells of three hunters who attempt to kill a brown bear.
The first loses his life to the bear because he lacks skill, the second also
falls to the bear because he acts without thought, and the third succeeds in
his kill because he’s skillful, acts thoughtfully, and speaks with respect and
humility to the bear, which then respects him in turn and allows itself to be
killed.
In another, a man who helps a mouse over a windfall is later helped by that
mouse to feed his starving family.
You put the bones of the salmon back into the water so that it might “put
on its clothes again” and return to feed you the following summer. But
throw bones on the ground and trample them, and you will end up
hungry.39
